# Example cython file showing how to define a python module
# containing the custom Atom Types. The cython compiler will
# convert this into the C++ file `chempydemo.cpp` which is
# then compiled into a shared object. The shared object can
# be loaded and used as a python module. See the `apps` directory
# for an example of using this.
