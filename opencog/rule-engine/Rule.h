/**
 * Class for managing rules in the URE.
 *
 * A URE rule has the following formats
 *
 * 1. A single forward only premises to conclusion rule such as
 *
 * <premise-1>
 * ...
 * <premise-1>
 * |-
 * <conclusion>
 *
 * is represented as
 *
 * BindLink
 *    <variables>
 *    AndLink
 *       <premise-1>
 *       ...
 *       <premise-n>
 *    <conclusion>
 *
 * <conclusion> may represent explicitly the conclusion pattern, or
 * (most of the cases) it may be obfuscated in a grounded schema
 * node. In the such a case one the following format may be used. Note
 * that if the rule uses a GroundedSchema and no backward form in used
 * (as described below) then the last argument of the GroundedSchema
 * will represent the rule's conclusion pattern.
 *
 * 2. A list starting with a forward format and optionally 1 or more
 * backward forms. The backward forms allow to easily obtain
 * conclusion patterns and possibly reconstruct premises given a
 * conclusion. In such a case a rule is represented as follows
 *
 * ListLink
 *    <forward>
 *    <backward-1>
 *    ...
 *    <backward-n>
 *
 * Where <forward> is described as in 1. and backward-i is either
 *
 *    BindLink
 *       <variables>
 *       <conclusion>
 *       AndLink
 *          <premise-1>
 *          ...
 *          <premise-n>
 *
 * or if we don't need to translate a certain conclusion into premises
 *
 *    GetLink
 *       <variables>
 *       <conclusion>
 *
 * That second notation (forward and backward forms) is necessary when
 * the forward rule output(s) is obfuscated by a grounded schema(ta)
 * or can as well be useful when the transformations going from
 * conclusion to premises is non trivial. The reason we have several
 * backward forms is because a forward rule output several conclusions
 * (take for instance the PLN equivalence-to-double-implication rule
 * that given A<->B outputs A-> and B->A).
