# Query Processing / Pattern Matching Runtime

Query processing and pattern-matching is a form of "fill-in-the-blanks"
operation. Given a template pattern, with "blanks" in it, a search is
performed for all graphs that match, and can "fill in" those "blanks".
Each "blank" is called a "variable", and each (sub-)graph that can "fit"
into that "blank" or "hole" is called a "grounding". The pattern matcher
finds groundings for variables.

Pattern querying in the AtomSpace is split into two parts: a "compile"
step, and a "execute/run" step. Pattern compilation is done by code in
the `opencog/atoms/pattern` directory. Pattern execution is done by
code in this directory. Compilation has to be done only once per
pattern; after that, the query can be run quickly many times.

This README gives a general overview of both steps.

Performing a query of a graphical pattern can be thought of in several
ways. One way is to think of it as "solving the subgraph isomorphism
problem", which is exactly what the code here does.

The subgraph isomorphism algorithm implemented here is used for many
different AtomSpace functions, including graph-database query processing,
inverted query search, graph-rewriting, graph satisfiability and
"satisfiability modulo theories".

In addition, graph patterns can be thought of as "rewrite rules" or
"productions", and thus can be chained together in sequences to perform
inferencing, natural deduction and parsing.  Forward and backward
chaining are implemented separately, in the `opencog/ure`
directory.

The first part of this README describes the generic algorithm; the
second part describes some of its applications to query processing,
graph rewriting, unification, satisfiability and satisfiability modulo
theories.

A simple example of one possible use of this code is shown in the file
[`simple.scm`](/examples/pattern-matcher/simple.scm).


A Quick Sketch
--------------
The basic idea is that one can specify a pattern or template, in the
form of a graph, some of whose nodes are variables.  The pattern
matcher can then find all other graphs that match the given template,
substituting for the variables. Thus, one has:

 * A Hypergraph Query Language (HQL), that, much like SQL, allows you
   to define a query statement, and ask for all graphs that match. This
   makes the AtomSpace a kind of graphical database.

 * When a variable in the pattern matches some (sub-)graph, that match
   is called a "grounding". When all of the variables in the entire
   pattern can be consistently grounded, one can say that the query
   pattern is "satisfied", in the mathematical sense of "satisfiability".
   Thus, the pattern matcher is a (graphical) satisfiability solver.

 * Given the variable groundings returned by the query, one can create
   new graphs. Thus, the pattern matcher is a natural foundation for
   graph re-writing.

 * The template pattern is specified as a collection of trees; it is
   the union of these trees that defines the query graph.  The vertexes
   in the tree are typed (in the Comp-Sci sense of "Type Theory"; they
   are AtomSpace "Atoms"). Thus, each tree can be understood to be a
   "term", in the sense of a "term algebra" (this is a concept from the
   theory of "term rewriting", derived from mathematical logic.)

 * The same variable can appear in different parts of the template. All
   solutions must therefore have the same grounding for that variable,
   thus, the pattern matcher performs "unification".  The pattern
   matcher can unify N terms at the same time (and not just two).

 * The query-pattern is itself represented as a graph, and is stored in
   the AtomSpace. This means that "inverse queries" can be performed.
   For example, given a graph with no variables in it, one can search
   for all queries that would return this graph. This function is
   commonly employed in chatbots, where the pattern-with-no-variables
   is the sentence that was heard, and the matching patterns-with-variables
   are anchors to all of the ways in which the input could be responded
   to.

 * Certain subgraphs are "evaluatable", other subgraphs are
   "executable". Evaluatable graphs are those that can be evaluated, in
   the sense of functional programming, and the result of evaluation is
   a truth value. Executable graphs are likewise, except that the result
   is another graph.

 * During the pattern search, the evaluatable subgraphs are evaluated
   to determine if they evaluate to "true", thus allowing the search
   to continue.  This implies that the pattern matcher is a kind of
   "satisfiability modulo theories" solver: when it determines that
   two subgraphs are equal, it is applying the "equational theory"
   given by functions (graphs) that are evaluatable. Simple arithmetic
   theory is built-in, and thus, for example, the pattern matcher can
   prove that the equation 5 = 2 + 3 holds (is satisfied, modulo the
   theory of addition), while 7 + x = 3 + x is false (not satisfiable).

 * Queries can also test for term-absence, i.e. to reject matches when
   some portion of the template pattern is present.  This is confusingly
   similar to the concept of "negation", but is subtly different:
   absence of a term is not the same as falsity. In particular, there is
   no "law of the excluded middle" (it simply does not make sense for
   term absence) and so the matching algorithm can be said to implement
   a form of "intuitionistic logic".


Subgraph Isomorphism Discovery
------------------------------

Given a small (hyper-)graph and a bigger "universe" (hyper-)graph, the
subgraph isomorphism problem requires one to find the corresponding
smaller graph within the universe graph.  The smaller graph may include
one or more variables; these will be given groundings. That is, a variable
might match any corresponding node or link in the universe, as long as it
occurs in the correct "location" of the surrounding graph. Thus,
subgraph matching de-facto performs a kind of "variable unification", and
can be used to perform query processing, to "fill in the blanks".

The subgraph matching algorithm implemented here is more or less
completely general.  The API to it provides for user-defined callbacks
that can be used to modify the search:

 * Define what constitutes a 'match' (for individual nodes, links and
   clauses),
 * Support for optional clauses (portions of the subgraph, which if
   found, are also returned; commonly used to reject certain types of
   patterns),
 * Support for search-order ranking (re-ordering the incoming set,
   e.g. by priority), or even truncation of the incoming set.
 * Support for the search start location (again, to potentially limit
   the total search).
 * Solution acceptance callback, to provide on-the-fly reporting, and
   limit the total number of groundings reported.
 * Support for a back-tracking callback. During the search, the
   pattern matcher will typically need to backtrack; this callback
   allows user-defined algorithms to push and pop stacks as
   appropriate, as well.

An additional, very important feature is support for 'virtual'
hypergraphs: those that are not pre-existing in the fixed universe
(i.e. in the AtomSpace), but are only defined algorithmically, by a
predicate function that returns a yes/no answer about their existence.
An example would be "greater-than": this graph 'virtually' exists,
but only if the number on the right-hand-side is greater than the
number on the left-hand side.  Clearly, it is impossible for the
AtomSpace to contain every possible number (there are infinitely
many numbers!), and so it cannot possibly contain all possible
number-pairs. However, computing the "greater-than" operation is
very easy: its just some short, simple algorithm.  Thus, virtual
hypergraphs provide a way of computing relations on-the-fly, as needed.
The pattern matcher is able to correctly find subgraphs that contain
such virtual hypergraphs.

Another important and perhaps under-appreciated function is the
ability to search through unordered links.  When the query subgraph
contains one or more unordered links, the subgraph isomorphism may
exist only for certain permutations of the unordered link.  Thus,
during search, all possible permutations of an unordered link must be
explored.  This increases the size of the search space by
combinatorial factors, and requires a significantly more complex
algorithm to deal with nested unordered links.

The algorithm itself performs an exhaustive search, and can therefore
in principle encounter a combinatorial explosion of the search space,
leading to very long run-times.  This appears not to happen for most
"ordinary" problems, so is usually not a practical issue. However, it
is not hard to create a problem with several large unordered links that
have to be grounded, together with a slowly-running virtual link:
for example, matching an unordered set with N variables in it, with the
"foo" relation: this will generate N-factorial solutions, and will take
N-factorial times runtime-of-foo to complete the search.

Under "normal" circumstances, the algorithm reports each result
exactly once.  However, in certain graphs having a common subexpression,
arranged in a particular way, identical solutions may be repeated more
than once. (With the current algorithm, this occurs when the common
subexpression occurs within different singleton links, and the different
singleton links are all contained within the same link. A solution
will be reported once for each such singleton. This situation would
surely never occur during any sort of "typical" usage. See the
ArcanaUTest::test_repeats() unit test for an example.)

The algorithm splits naturally into two steps: an analysis/compilation
step, and a runtime step. The analysis step is quite complex, extracting
structure from the pattern in such a way as to make the actual run-time
match run quickly. The idea is that a pattern might be specified once,
but then re-used (re-run) many times. Thus, it is important for it to
run quickly, at the expense of longer compile times. Analysis includes:

* Extraction of variable locations.
* Identification of evaluatable terms.
* Identification of those unordered sets whose permutations will need
  to be explored.
* Determination of whether the template-graph is fully connected, or
  is a product of disjoint graphs. Disjoint subgraphs can be each
  matched individually; the final solution-set is merely a product of
  the solution-sets of the disjoint pieces.
* Determination of whether the template-graph is fully connected, after
  all virtual terms have been removed. If it consists of disjoint
  pieces, then these are grounded first, and then re-assembled by
  evaluating the virtual links.

Pattern compilation is non-trivial.  Thus, in certain very simple cases,
it might be faster (and probably simpler) for you, the user, to obtain
the desired graphs directly, instead of using the pattern matcher. Of
course, this looses generality, and forces you to write strange custom
code. The effort may or may not be worth it.  The strength of the
pattern matcher is its ability to handle large, complex graphs with
multiple variables interacting in difficult ways (or even graphs with
no constant nodes in them at all!)

The subgraph isomorphism algorithm itself does not make use of or
require the AtomSpace: it simply traces connections between links by
traversing the incoming and outgoing sets. The AtomSpace is required
in only two places: to find a set of starting points for the search
(e.g. by finding all nodes of a given type), and as the location into
which new graphs are inserted (during graph-re-writing).


Example: Clauses and Groundings
-------------------------------

An AtomSpace hypergraph is most easily understood as a collection of
trees formed by the "outgoing set" of an AtomSpace Link.  Each internal
vertex of a tree is called a "Link".  Each leaf of a tree is called
a "Node". The trees are not disjoint, however: Nodes and Links can be
shared. In the AtomSpace, every Node and Link is forced to be unique;
it is impossible to have two Nodes or Links that are identical.
(This is analogous to the common uniqueness constraint in ordinary
databases: for any physical item, you typically want to have only one
corresponding database record.)

When trees share common Nodes or Links, they become connected. When they
share many of them, they become entangled. Thus, the AtomSpace contents
don't so much resemble a "forest of trees" as they resemble a dense
matted structure like felt, or, more accurately, a rhizome. (Search for
pictures, if you don't know what that is.) Mathematically, the proper
name for the structure is an "incidence graph", or, even more properly,
a bipartite "Levi Graph".

Normally, all trees are finite in size.  There is a way of defining
infinite trees, as patchwork of finite subtrees quilted together into
a recursive structure.  This can be done with either the `DefineLink`
(which is static) or the `StateLink` (which is mutable). The pattern
matcher supports the traversal of such infinite trees: it merely stops
at the boundaries of the repeated segments.

In the discussion below, and in the code, these trees are usually called
"clauses". This is in distinction to "terms", which are sub-trees of the
clauses.  The input to the pattern matcher is given by a set of clauses
to be matched.

Consider the following example taken from a dependency parse of the
English language sentence "John threw a ball":

    _subj(throw, John)
    _obj(throw, ball)

There are two ways of drawing a graph to represent the above. In
linguistics, one simply draws labelled arrows. In the AtomSpace,
there are no "labelled arrows"; there are only Nodes and Links.
Nodes are just labels, and nothing else; Links are n-ary collections
of other Nodes or Links, and have no label at all. (Nodes correspond
to the notion of "constants" and "variables" in mathematical logic
(aka "model theory") and Links correspond to terms and relations.)

The natural AtomSpace representation for the above is as a pair of
trees, two levels deep. It's drawn as ASCII-art, here:
```
         ListLink
         /       \
        v         \
     Node:_obj     \
                    v
                 ListLink
                 /       \
                v         v
          Node:throw    Node:ball
```
which can be written more compactly by using indentation to denote
nesting:
```
    ListLink
         Node "_obj"
         ListLink
              Node "throw"
              Node "ball"
```
or even more compactly using parenthesis ("S-expressions"):
```
   (ListLink (Node "_obj") (ListLink (Node "throw") (Node "ball")))
```

In practice, more the Node and Link types are more specific. The actual
representation will be:
```
    EvaluationLink
       PredicateNode "_subj"
       ListLink
          WordNode "throw"
          WordNode "John"

    EvaluationLink
       PredicateNode "_obj"
       ListLink
          WordNode "throw"
          WordNode "ball"
```
Here, the indentation level describes the tree structure. The Links
and Nodes are indicated by name: the Nodes are always leaves of the
tree. The two trees (i.e. "clauses") above share a single, common Node:
that for "throw".

For the above example, pattern matching can be used to form a simple
question-answering system, by "filling in the blanks".  The dependency
parse for the question "What did John throw?" can be written as:
```
    _subj(throw, John)
    _obj(throw, _$qVar)
```
By comparing to the previous graph, it is obvious that the variable
`_$qVar` can be directly matched to the word "ball", thus answering the
question.  This illustrates the simplest use of the system, as a
kind-of fill-in-the-blanks solver, for elementary-school word
problems: "What did John throw? John threw a ____."

The solution or answer is "ball". This is referred to as a "grounding"
for the "variable" `_$qVar`.   The terminology of "grounding" and
"variable" is meant to be identical to the terminology commonly used
in textbooks on model theory, lambda calculus and first-order logic:
these are the very same ideas, expressed as hypergraphs.  In
particular, each "clause" or "tree" in the hypergraph incidence graph
corresponds to an "atomic expression" in a term algebra or in
first-order logic.  The search pattern or query pattern that the
pattern matcher matches against is an "expression" or "sentence"
containing variables.  The act of finding groundings for the variables
is identical to performing variable "unification".

The pattern matcher uses `VariableNodes` to represent variables. The
proper representation for the above query is thus:

    EvaluationLink
       PredicateNode "_obj"
       ListLink
          WordNode "throw"
          VariableNode "_$qVar"

The query pattern consists of one or more clauses, such as the above.
The query pattern is essentially a boolean-and of these clauses: all
of the clauses must be satisfied (with the exception of optional
clauses; see later discussion for this).  All clauses MUST contain at
least one variable: if they do not, they are constant clauses, and are
ignored.  This is because constant clauses are "trivial": the groundings
for them can only be themselves, trivially, and so nothings needs be
done.


Algorithm overview
==================

The following sections present the algorithm details.

### Terminology

* A "clause" is a tree, typically containing one or more variables.

* A "pattern", "template" or "query" is a set of clauses. All three
  words are used interchangeably to mean the same thing: some graph
  that is supposed to be matched.

* A "term" is a subtree of a clause.

* A "grounding" is a proposed substitution for a variable. A term
  containing a grounding must be isomorphic to the term containing
  the variable, after the variable is substituted-for. (They must
  be identical.)

* A "solution" is a graph that provides a grounding for the query. The
  solution must be self-consistent, in that each distinct variable has
  only one distinct grounding (for that solution) and the solution-graph
  is identical to the query-graph, after the variables are substituted by
  their grounds.

* A "satisfying set" is the set of groundings of variables that provide
  a consistent solution.

* An "ungrounded graph" is a graph that has one or more variables in it.

### The Basic Algorithmic Idea

The basic idea is to treat the query as a graph, in which are embedded
some number of variables or unknowns. This query graph can be loosely
understood to be kind of like a predicate, in that the query is solved
only when the variables take on appropriate values, i.e. when the
variables are grounded.

The goal of query processing is to scan the collection of all knowledge,
(the "universe hypergraph"), looking for a subgraph that matches the
template. The nodes that fit where the unknowns would go are then the
answer (grounding) to the query.

The problem of finding certain subgraphs within graphs is known as the
"subgraph isomorphism problem" or the "subgraph matching problem", and
one uses a "subgraph isomorphism algorithm" to find the match.

The input to the algorithm is a set of trees. Because each tree may have
several groundings, the algorithm maintains a stack to hold intermediate
groundings, as the universe is explored. A solution is declared when
every tree has been grounded. If no grounding is found, or if additional
solutions are to be searched for, the algorithm will backtrack to the
most recent unexplored part of the universe, popping the stack as it
backtracks. In this sense, the algorithm resembles a pushdown automaton.
Since pushdown automata are associated with context-free languages,
the subgraph isomorphism problem is effectively a problem in
recognizing a context-free language.


### Currently Implemented Algorithm

Additional detailed discussion can be found in a different README file:
the [README-Algorithm](README-Algorithm.md) file.

1. The search-variables in the input pattern must be explicitly
   declared. Only these explicitly-declared variables will be grounded.
   Any other variables that have not been explicitly declared will be
   treated as constants. The explicitly-declared variables are called
   "bound variables". Any other variables in the input pattern are
   called "free variables".

2. During pattern compilation, the location of each variable in the
   query is extracted, and cached in a map.

3. A connectivity map is created, indicating which clauses share common
   variables. This is used during traversal, to select the next clause
   to explore. See `PatternMatchEngine::_connectivity_map`. That is,
   once a clause is fully grounded, one can then start on matching
   the next clause: the next clause is one that has at least one
   variable that has already been grounded.

4. Actually, there's a whole-lotta stuff that is done during pattern
   compilation, including the extraction of optional clauses, the
   extraction of virtual terms, extraction of evaluatable predicates,
   which are not matched, but are instead evaluated for truth/falsehood.
   See the other READMEs and the code itself for details.

5. Acceptance of a proposed grounding is done by means of callbacks,
   in the `class PatternMatchCallback` structure. These include
   callbacks that can accept or reject a Node or Link match, a callback
   that is called before a Link match is even started, a callback
   to accept or reject a single grounded clause, etc. See the file
   `PatternMatchCallback.h` for details. The various `Mixin` classes
   provide a very reasonable set of default callbacks that work
   in "the expected way"; there are a handful of other special-purpose
   callbacks to solve various problems.

6. A starting point for the search is selected. The starting point is
   usually a constant atom that occurs in one of the clauses. Usually,
   the constant term with the smallest incoming set is selected; this
   is called the "thinnest term", under the belief that this will result
   in the most efficient search. When there are no constant terms in
   any of the clauses, different techniques are used to pick a starting
   location.  The algorithms for picking the starting points are
   provided in default callbacks, in `InitiateSearchMixin`. These can
   be overloaded for custom searches.

7. Search begins with the clause containing the thinnest term. Search
   is performed upwards (i.e. following the edges in the incoming set).
   Each edge in the incoming set forms a distinct grounding possibility,
   thus, the current search state is pushed onto a stack; this is then
   popped, when exploration of that edge has completed. See
   `PatternMatchEngine::explore_neighborhood()` for details.

8. When an unordered set is encountered in the search, each possible
   permutation of that set forms a distinct grounding possibility.
   Thus, the current permutation is pushed onto a stack; this is then
   popped, when all possible permutations have been considered.

9. The `ChoiceLink` provides an explicit menu of terms to be grounded.
   Only one term in the menu needs to be grounded. Thus, each term
   in the `ChoiceLink` forms a distinct grounding possibility. The
   current choice is pushed onto a stack, and popped after the
   exploration of that choice has completed.

10. The `GlobNode` is a `VariableNode` that can be grounded by multiple
   adjacent list elements. This is in contrast to `VariableNode`s, which
   can be grounded by only one Atom at a time. `GlobNode`s are analogous
   to the concept of "globing" in regex matching: they effectively
   embody more-or-less exactly the same idea. Each possible distinct
   grounding of a `GlobNode` represents a distinct branch to explore.
   Thus, the current glob grounding is pushed onto a stack, and popped
   after the the possibilities of that glob have been completely
   explored.

11. After a clause is fully grounded, exploration proceeds to another
   clause that is connected to it: i.e. containing a variable that has
   already been grounded. As this represents another exploration
   possibility, another stack of currently-grounded clauses is
   maintained. See `PatternMatchEngine::get_next_untried_clause()`
   for details.

12. Partial solutions are recorded in `PatternMatchEngine::var_grounding`
   and `PatternMatchEngine::clause_grounding`. These are recorded on
   the stack, for hopefully "obvious" reasons.

   (Multiple solution graphs may overlap.  Thus, if the universe
   contains the statement: "John threw a ball and a rock." and the
   query is "What did John throw?", then there are two valid subgraph
   matches: "John threw a ball" and "John threw a rock".  Both of these
   solutions contain a common subgraph, "John threw...", which must be
   reachable, and must be reconsidered, after one solution is proposed.
   In particular, this implies that the partial solution state must be
   kept on stack, so that the backtracking can be performed to find
   other, overlapping solutions.)

13. When all clauses have been fully grounded, a solution is reported.
   After this, additional solutions are searched for, by progressively
   popping the various stacks, and exploring other previously-unexplored
   possibilities.

14. In addition to a list of clauses that MUST be grounded, the algorithm
   accepts a list of clauses that need only be optionally grounded. The
   optional list is exactly that: if no grounding is found, that's OK,
   and a solution is still reported for the must-list. The optional
   list can be used to implement pattern-rejection: so, for example,
   if a grounding for an optional clause is found, then the match as
   as a whole can be rejected. This kind of pattern-rejection is
   explicitly done with the crisp-boolean-logic callback.


### Relations (Virtual Links)

A pattern may consist of query-terms, which must be explicitly
grounded, as term-algebra-terms, and also "relations", which are
a kind of term that evaluates to a true/false value. When a relation
evaluates to false, that particular associated grounding is rejected;
otherwise it is accepted, and the remainder of the search is performed.

Relations are implemented as VirtualLinks. These encapsulate
algorithmically-determined relations. The primordial example is
`GreaterThanLink`, which is evaluated on-the-fly to determine it's
truth-hood. It is called "virtual" because it is impossible to
store every-possible greater-than relation between numbers: there
is an infinity of these. This is in direct contrast to non-virtual,
concrete knowledge declarations: e.g. "every cat is an animal" which
can be evaluated to be true or false, but which will be concretely
present in the AtomSpace. Concrete, explicit knowledge declaration
is needed, because there is no generic algorithm that can evaluate
the truth-hood of "every X is a Y".

Not all virtual links are relations; the arithmetic links: `PlusLink`,
`TimesLink`, etc. are virtual, but do not have true/false evaluation
results.

Relations are handled in two steps. During pattern compilation, all
relations are removed from the pattern, and then the pattern is analyzed
for connectivity. In the general case, the pattern will decompose into
multiple, disjoint connected components, with the virtual links being
the only connection between them.

During run-time, each disjoint component is independently grounded. Then,
each combinatoric possibility of each grounding is brought together,
submitted to the relation links as candidates. If the virtual link
evaluates to true, then this combination is accepted. Processing
proceeds until all components have been assembled, and all virtual
relation links have been considered. The resulting combination is
reported. Then, backtracking resumes, to examine the next possible
combination.

Note that having multiple disconnected components joined only by
virtual links leads to a multiplicatively explosive set of combinations
to examine. (Luckily, if there is only one virtual link, then this
combinatoric explosion can be avoided, and regular grounding can be
done. Alternately, a query may consist of only one connected component,
with relations links spanning parts of it.)

### Unordered Links

The use of unordered links within a pattern provides a special
challenge for the pattern matcher. This is because each possible
permutation of an unordered link must be explored.  Consider, for
example, the search pattern:
```
    AndLink
       SetLink
          VariableNode $a
          VariableNode $b
       ListLink
          VariableNode $a
          ConceptNode "fizz"
```
If the universe contains the graphs:
```
    SetLink
       ConceptNode "dribble"
       ConceptNode "bubble"

    ListLink
       ConceptNode "bubble"
       ConceptNode "fizz"
```
then one must consider that `$a` might be grounded by "bubble" (and
so a match is found), or that `$a` could have been grounded by
"dribble" (although this is not consistent with the `ListLink`, and
so no overall match exists).  That is, all possible permutations of
the SetLink must be considered when searching for groundings. This
can lead to a combinatoric explosion.

Backtracking through unordered links is a challenge. To better
understand this challenge, there are four distinct scenarios that
can occur during pattern matching.  These are:

A) One is at the bottom, and is searching upwards, and encounters
   an unordered link as a parent of the current atom.

B) One is at the bottom, moving upwards, and during the (downward)
   `tree_compare()`'s that must be performed at each stage, there is
   an unordered set somewhere in a subtree.

C) Situations A) and B) can occur in a nested fashion, so that an
   unordered link may have another unordered link inside of it.
   All of this is happening within the same clause.

D) There may be other unordered links in other clauses (possibly
   sharing variables with the unordered links in this clause).

Note that, for situation A), as one continues to move upwards, the
downward tree-compare effectively looks like situation B).

Situation D) is easily dealt with by using the existing
backtracking infrastructure, and so presents no new challenges.

Performance
-----------
All of the uses of the word "combinatoric explosion" in the above may
have you alarmed. Not to worry. Performance is fast! In "typical"
datasets containing many millions of atoms, all "typical" queries run
in milliseconds or less.  This is in part because, at least so far, most
"typical" knowledge-graphs have a Zipfian distribution and connectivity,
which means that there are very few extremely large subgraphs. By
starting the search with the "thinnest" subgraph, one almost never
encounters these fat graphs, and so they don't have to be explored.

Tutorials and Examples
----------------------
The `opencog/examples/pattern-matcher` directory contains twenty-five
distinct, different tutorial-examples that progressively demonstrate
the various features of the system.

Summary
-------

The above describes a specific implementation of a subgraph matching
algorithm. It is generic, in that it makes no reference to the
specifics of the actual data layout, or of node equivalences in the
data.  The only restriction made is that the input, query graph,
has been decomposed into a set of trees.

You can stop reading now. The below are just some random remarks of
rather low importance, that might be useful to someone for something.

Open Questions
--------------

In many ways, the above algorithm resembles that of a recursive descent
parser.  However, it does a *lot* of backtracking during its solution
search. It is thoroughly unclear as to whether the hypergraph
pattern-matching problem can be reformulated to resemble an LL(k)
grammar, so that linear-time predictive parsing techniques can be used.

(Probably not!? The situation might be analogous to the difference
between a nondeterministic finite automaton, and a regular one: the
description can be exponentially smaller; the corresponding
deterministic automaton is exponentially larger. So also here: perhaps
there is an equivalent LL(k) grammar, but it is exponentially larger,
thus negating the linear-timer performance. Or something like that.
This is just hand-waving.)

In many ways, the above algorithm resembles a boolean satisfiability
problem, except that, instead of having a two-valued true/false logic,
it is a many-valued logic (with each variable ranging over the
universe of allowed values for that variable). The standard technique
for solving boolean-SAT is to examine the graph, trim away all trees
that are not multiply connected, ground the remaining
multiply-connected knot at the center of things, and then re-attach the
trees. Perhaps something similar could be done here? Would it actually
be faster? I suppose that depends on the actual query...


Forward Chainer
---------------

The `PatternLink::satisfy()` method implements a critical component for a
forward chainer: it is able to accept a BindLink, containing a pattern
and a rewriting rule, and basically implement a form of IF ... THEN
... statement, expressed as an AtomSpace hypergraph.

Properly, one writes "IF ... THEN ..." as "IF predicate THEN implicand".
The predicate is presumed to contain VariableNodes, while the implicand
is a hypergraph making used of those VariableNodes.  The predicate is
run through the pattern-matching engine. When groundings for the
variables are found, then a hypergraph is created based on the implicand,
using the grounded values found.  Because there may be more than one
grounding, a SetLink of all grounded implicands is returned.

Thus, the `PatternLink::satisfy()` method can be used to implement a
simple forward-chainer. For example, one may create a collection of
BindLinks. Then, calling each in turn, from a loop, will cause each to
be evaluated. Thus, N iterations of the loop is equivalent to chaining
N levels deep.


Hypergraph Query Language (HQL)
-------------------------------

A "hypergraph query language" is a language that allows queries to be
expressed as strings. Given *any* way of writing down a hypergraph as
a string, a hypergraph query language can be trivially formed by adding
variables to the expression, in exactly the same way that one adds
variables to predicate logic to get first-order logic.  In order to feel
comfortable to programmers, the query language should maintain the
outward form of SQL, SPARQL, RQL, etc.

So, for example, a hypergraph might be written as a list
of links, and their contents:

    <hypergraph> := { <link-type> <atom> <atom> ... <atom>.
                      <link-type> <atom> <atom> ... <atom>.
                      ...
                      <link-type> <atom> <atom> ... <atom>.
                    }

Here, <atom> is understood to refer to a specific, constant atom.
Let ?var be a variable.  Then define <vatom> as

    <vatom> :=  <atom> | ?var

That is, a vatom is a constant atom, or a variable. A hypergraph
with variables in it is then

    <v-hypergraph> := { <link-type> <vatom> <vatom> ... <vatom>.
                        <link-type> <vatom> <vatom> ... <vatom>.
                        ...
                        <link-type> <vatom> <vatom> ... <vatom>.
                      }

An HQL query, resembling the syntax used in SQL or SPARQL, is then

    SELECT ?var-a ?var-b ... ?var-z WHERE <v-hypergraph>;

So, for example, the hypergraph for

    _subj(throw, John )
    _obj(throw, ball)

is somewhat complicated to write down, but vaguely resembles

    { ?x WORD_NODE John.
      ?y WORD_NODE throw.
      ?z WORD_NODE ball.
      RELEX_LINK _subj ?y ?x.
      RELEX_LINK _obj  ?y ?z.
    }

The query to determine what John threw would then be:

    SELECT ?item WHERE
      { ?x WORD_NODE John.
        ?y WORD_NODE throw.
        RELEX_LINK _subj ?y ?x.
        RELEX_LINK _obj  ?y ?item.
      }

There is currently no code that will actually parse such strings, and
return the query results, although, in principle, writing such code
would not be hard.  In practice, its a little more subtle than that:
we've glossed over the idea that truth values could be queryable, or
that truth values would need to have some minimum/maximum value, or
that atom types could be queryable.  Also, the representation of RelEx
expressions in Atomese is considerably more complicated than the above.

To overcome these difficulties, it is strongly suggested (would make
sense) to create the actual query language from within the scheme
bindings. This is because it is straight-forward, in scheme, to create
the "syntactic sugar" to hide RelEx intricacies, and hide many of the
other nasty details, while keeping a nice and simple interface for the
user.

What is currently implemented is "English as a query language". That is,
queries are posed in English, such as "What did John throw?". These are
parsed by RelEx and turned into Atomese hypergraphs with embedded query
variables (_$qVar) in them.  The code in this directory will process
these queries, and return values for _$qVar.

Thus, at least for RelEx-based queries, there is no need for HQL, as
using the English language is (a lot) easier than writing a formal
HQL query.  In this sense, English is the "best" query language, and
it is supported.


TODO
----
 * Performance: If all variables in a clause have been grounded, then
   there is no need to explore the clause; we only need to plug the
   variables in, and see if the corresponding link exists. The
   prototypical case for this is
```
      (Get (And
          (Link (Glob "head") (Foo) (Glob "tail"))
          (Link (Glob "head") (Bar) (Glob "tail"))))
```
   So if the `Foo` clause was matched, the existance of a `Bar` clause
   can be trivially verified.

 * API change: Instead of returning results wrapped in a huge SetLink,
   the results should be returned, linked to some anchor. Huge SetLinks
   suck. There's an open github issue for this: issue #1502.

 * Performance: If a bind-link is of the form `(Bind $X $Y body term)`
   and variable $Y does not appear anywhere in term, then repeated
   groundings for $Y can be avoided, and should be avoided.

 * Performance: If a bind-link is of the form `(Bind variables term term)`
   then there is no point in instantiating `term` a second time - just
   repeat what is there.

 * API enhancement: A not-uncommon search is to create a temporary
   BindLink, perform the search, get the results, and then trash the
   BindLink and the SetLink that the results came in. This is ...
   annoyingly inefficient. Also not inherently thread-safe.  It can
   be worked around by placing the BindLink, and the search results
   in a temporary AtomSpace, but this is ... kind-of-ish icky?
   Can we do something nicer, here?

 * AtomSpaces are done wrong. Grounding should always be performed
   in the same AtomSpace that the BindLink is in.  This should be fetched
   directly from the bind-link, and not passed as a third-party parameter.
