/*****************************************************************

How do unordered links work?
----------------------------
This is complicated, so we write it out.  When ascending from below (i.e.
from do_term_up()), unordered links may be found in two different
places: The parent term may be unordered, or the parent link may hold
another link (a sibling to us) that is unordered. Traversal needs to
handle both cases.  Thus, the upwards-movement methods (do_term_up(),
explore_up_branches(), etc.) are incapable of discovering unordered links,
as they cannot "see" the siblings.  Siblings can only be found during
tree-compare, moving downwards.  Thus, tree_compare must do a lot of
heavy lifting.

When comparing trees downwards, we have two situations we may be in:
  1) we may be asked to compare things exactly like last time,
     (take_step == false)
  2) we may be asked to try out the next permutation.
     (take_step == true)
Our behavior is thus controlled by the `take_step` flag.
We need to report back two bits of state: whether or not we found a match,
and whether or not there are more permutation possibilities to explore
(the `have_more` boolean flag).

The topmost routine to call tree_compare must *always* set _have_more=F
and _take_step=T before calling tree_compare.  This will cause
tree_compare to advance to the next matching permutation, or to run until
all permutations are exhausted, and no match was found.

Odometers
---------
Stepping through all possible permutations is "easy" for just one
unordered link. If there are more than one, then several difficulties
arise.  These are, roughly:

A) Two (or more) unordered links that are siblings to one another.
   These can be visualized as being in left-right order; they are
   strung together to form an "odometer". The odometer must spin as all
   odometers do: all possible permutations of the right-most link must
   be explored, before even one step of the left link can be taken.
   Then, once the left link takes a step, all possible permutations
   of the right-most link must be tried, again.  This is solved by
   having a `perm_to_step` pointer: it indicates whose turn it is to
   take one step.

B) Two (or more) unordered links are in a parent-chiled relationship.
   This is similar to the odometer situation, in that all permutations
   of the child must be explored before the parent can take a step.
   It could be treated much as the above, with the understanding that
   intervening ordered links mean that state needs to be held on stack.

C) Nested odometers: that is, combinations of case A) and case B).
   This is where most of the complexity comes in: we have to track
   both parent-child relationships, as well as sibling relationships.
   Part of the problem is that we don't known, a priori, whether or
   not there is more than on unordered link, or not, until we hit it.
   If there is more than one, its not immediately obvious if it is a
   sibiling or a descendant. (Perhaps some of this complexity could
   be avoided during pattern compilation, i.e. when PatternLink gets
   created: we could analyze the structure up front, and then make
   use of it during traversal. This is not doen right now (2019).)

There's a final bit of complexity: we might be hitting unordered links
for the first time, as we traverse up from below (e.g. by tracing from
a joining variable in a different clause) or we might be traversing
from above. The order in which steps are taken depend on this traversal
stack: thus, its alwways the case that permutations of links higher in
the stack are explored first, before those lower in the stack.

/**
 * tree_compare compares two trees, side-by-side.
 *
 * Compare two incidence trees, side-by-side.  The incidence tree is
 * given by following the "outgoing set" of the links appearing in the
 * tree.  The incidence tree is the so-called "Levi graph" of the
 * hypergraph.  The first arg should be a handle to a term in the
 * pattern, while the second arg is a handle to a candidate grounding.
 * The pattern (template) clause is compared to the candidate grounding,
 * returning true if there is a match, else return false.
 *
 * The comparison is recursive, so this method calls itself on each
 * subtree (term) of the template term, performing comparisons until a
 * match is found (or not found).
 *
 * The pattern clause may contain quotes (QuoteLinks), which signify
 * that what follows must be treated as a literal (constant), rather
 * than being interpreted.  Thus, quotes can be used to search for
 * expressions containing variables (since a quoted variable is no
 * longer a variable, but a constant).  Quotes can also be used to
 * search for GroundedPredicateNodes (since a quoted GPN will be
 * treated as a constant, and not as a function).  Quotes can be nested,
 * only the first quote is used to escape into the literal context,
 * and so quotes can be used to search for expressions containing
 * quotes.  It is assumed that the QuoteLink has an arity of one, as
 * its quite unclear what an arity of more than one could ever mean.
 *
 * This method has side effects. The main one is to insert variable
 * groundings and term groundings into `var_grounding` when grounded
 * variables and grounded terms are discovered in the pattern. (A term
 * is gounded when all variables in it are grounded). This is done
 * progressively, so that earlier groundings will be recorded even if
 * later ones fail. Thus, in order to use this method safely, the caller
 * must make a temp copy of `var_grounding`, and restore the temp if
 * there is no match.

/**
 * Same as explore_clause_direct, but looks at the cache of pre-grounded
 * clauses, first. This saves some CPU time for certain patterns that
 * have repeated re-explorations of clauses. An example pattern is given
 * below. It's an example of some of the cpu-intensive searches in the
 * genome/proteome/reactome annotation code. Its looking for pathways
 * from start to endpoint. Because multiple paths exist, the endpoint
 * gets searched repeatedly. The caching avoids the repeated search.
 *
 * To make this discussion less abstract and more real, here's an
 * example, from the gene annotation code:

(Evaluation (Predicate "foo") (List (Concept "a") (Concept "start-point")))
(Evaluation (Predicate "foo") (List (Concept "b") (Concept "start-point")))
(Evaluation (Predicate "foo") (List (Concept "c") (Concept "start-point")))

(Evaluation (Predicate "bar") (List (Concept "w") (Concept "end-point")))
(Evaluation (Predicate "bar") (List (Concept "x") (Concept "end-point")))
(Evaluation (Predicate "bar") (List (Concept "y") (Concept "end-point")))
(Evaluation (Predicate "bar") (List (Concept "z") (Concept "end-point")))

; Multiple pathways connecting start and end-points.
(Inheritance (Concept "a") (Concept "z"))
(Inheritance (Concept "b") (Concept "z"))
(Inheritance (Concept "b") (Concept "y"))
(Inheritance (Concept "b") (Concept "x"))
(Inheritance (Concept "c") (Concept "x"))
(Inheritance (Concept "c") (Concept "w"))

(define find-pathways (Get (And
   (Evaluation (Predicate "foo") (List (Variable "$a") (Concept "start-point")))
   (Evaluation (Predicate "bar") (List (Variable "$z") (Concept "end-point")))
   (Inheritance (Variable "$a") (Variable "$z")))))

; (cog-execute! find-pathways)

 * In the above example, the start/end-points would be genes, and the
 * paths would be reactome grid paths. The above pattern has two cache
 * hits, one on "x" and one on the "z" end-point.
 *
 * There's no unit test for this. Caching does hurt some workloads by
 * as much as 5%. It helps the genome-annotation code by 25%.
 *
 * TODO: The implementation here is minimal - very simple, very basic.
 * One could get much fancier. For example, the cache could be held in
 * the atomspace (thus making it effective across multiple searches,
 * e.g. with different start points but with the same end-points.)
 * In this case, maybe the cache should be held in a special Value
 * attached to a clause.  Size and bloat issues occur with atomspace
 * caching; these would need to be managed.
 *
 * A different fancy approach would be to spot more complex recurring
 * sub-patterns, and cache those. This adds considerable complexity,
 * and would become effective only for large, complex searches, of
 * which I haven't seen any good examples of, yet.
