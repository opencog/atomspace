/*****************************************************************

How do unordered links work?
----------------------------
This is complicated, so we write it out.  When ascending from below (i.e.
from do_term_up()), unordered links may be found in two different
places: The parent term may be unordered, or the parent link may hold
another link (a sibling to us) that is unordered. Traversal needs to
handle both cases.  Thus, the upwards-movement methods (do_term_up(),
explore_up_branches(), etc.) are incapable of discovering unordered links,
as they cannot "see" the siblings.  Siblings can only be found during
tree-compare, moving downwards.  Thus, tree_compare must do a lot of
heavy lifting.

When comparing trees downwards, we have two situations we may be in:
we may be asked to compare things exactly like last time, or we may be
asked to try out the next permutation. We need to report back two bits
of state: whether or not we found a match, and whether or not we have
more possibilities to explore. Our behavior is thus controlled by this
third bit, as well as what happened below us.

The correct actions to take are best explored by truth tables: the
settings of the _take_step and _have_more flags on entry, and what to
do after running tree_compare downwards. These are handled by two
truth tables.

The topmost routine to call tree_compare must *always* set _have_more=F
and _take_step=T before calling tree_compare.  This will cause
tree_compare to advance to the next matching permutation, or to run until
all permutations are exhausted, and no match was found.


Flag settings upon entry
------------------------

     take  have
case step  more    Comments / Action to be Taken
---- ----  ----    -----------------------------
  A    T    T     Impossible, Who set have_more? Who set take_step?
  B    T    F     Normal entry: we are the first unordered link to be
                  hit during downward traversal. Proceed using the truth
                  table below.
  C    F    T     We are not the first unorder. Someone ran before us.
                  If we are in the very first permutation, (i.e. we are
                    entering for the first time) we must call downwards.
                    If this returns a mismatch, we must step until we
                    find a match, or until we exhaust all permutations.
                    See next table for what to return: we return cases
                    5, 7 or 8.
                  If we are not the first permutation, we could just
                    return T, because that is what we did last time.
                    i.e. we are told to not take a step, so we don't,
                    and we know a-priori last time were were here, we
                    must have returned a match.  Thus, we can return
                    case 5 below.  We cannot return case 7 because we
                    can't know what std::next_perm returns.
                    (See however, footnote below).
                  If we hold an evaluatable, we must call down.
  D    F    F     Perform same as C above.

Footnote: case C: Well, the reasoning there is almost right, but not
quite. If the unordered link contains a variable, and it is also not in
the direct line of exploration (i.e. its grounding is NOT recorded)
then its truthiness holds only for a grounding that no longer exists.
Thus, for case C, it is safer to always check.

However, by the above reasoning: if the grounding wasn't recorded
(because the link is not in the recursion path) then the permutation
should not be recorded either. It should start with a permutation from
nothing.  XXX FIXME ... except we have no test case that illustrates
this failure mode.  It would require a peer unordered link that takes
a different order when the parent changes. Perhaps unordered links
nested inside a ChoiceLink would trigger this?

If case B was encountered on entry, we call downwards ourselves, and
then report back, according to the truth table below.

     returned result flags
     take  have   got
case step  more  match    Comments / Action to be Taken
---- ----  ----  ----     ------------------------------
 1     T    T      T    Impossible, error: who set have_more w/o
                          taking step??
 2     T    T      F    ditto
 3     T    F      T    We have no unordered links below us; we are at
                        the bottom.  If there had been unordered links,
                        they would have cleared the take_step flag. The
                        match we detected is the same match the last
                        time we were here. So we take a step, call
                        down again, and keep stepping until there is a
                        match or until all permutations are exhausted.
                          If match, we return: take_step=F,
                            have_more = result of std::next_perm
                            (we return case 5 or 7)
                          If exhaust, we return take_step=F, have_more=F
                            (we return case 8)

 4     T    F      F    If we are not holding any evaluatable links,
                        then this is impossible, as last time we were
                        here, we returned T.  If we are holding
                        evaluatable links, then one of them changed its
                        mind. Oh well. Take a step, proceed as in case 3.

 5     F    T      T    Someone below us took a step. Do nothing.
                        Return case 5 flags.
 6     F    T      F    Impossible; link that took the step should have
                        stepped until match or exhaustion.
 7     F    F      T    Unusual; its the last match for a lower unordered
                        link. We report the match. We do not take a
                        step; we do set the have_more flag to indicate
                        that we ourselves still have more.  i.e. we
                        return case 5 flags.
 8     F    F      F    Typical; a lower unordered link ran to exhaustion,
                        and got nada.  So *we* take a step, and call
                        downwards again. We keep going till match or till
                        exhaustion. If there's a match, we expect to see
                        the case 5 flags, so we halt and return.  If we
                        exhaust, we return case 8.

The above assumes that the curr_perm() method always returns either
the current permutation, or it returns a fresh permutation. If it returned
a fresh permutation, this counts as "taking a step", so we need to know
this.

Notice that these rules never pushed or popped the have-more stack.
The have-more stack is only pushed/popped by other branch-points, before
they call compare_tree.

/**
 * tree_compare compares two trees, side-by-side.
 *
 * Compare two incidence trees, side-by-side.  The incidence tree is
 * given by following the "outgoing set" of the links appearing in the
 * tree.  The incidence tree is the so-called "Levi graph" of the
 * hypergraph.  The first arg should be a handle to a clause in the
 * pattern, while the second arg is a handle to a candidate grounding.
 * The pattern (template) clause is compared to the candidate grounding,
 * returning true if there is a mis-match.
 *
 * The comparison is recursive, so this method calls itself on each
 * subtree (term) of the template clause, performing comparisons until a
 * match is found (or not found).
 *
 * Return false if there's a mis-match. The goal here is to walk over
 * the entire tree, without mismatches.  Since a return value of false
 * stops the iteration, false is used to signal a mismatch.
 *
 * The pattern clause may contain quotes (QuoteLinks), which signify
 * that what follows must be treated as a literal (constant), rather
 * than being interpreted.  Thus, quotes can be used to search for
 * expressions containing variables (since a quoted variable is no
 * longer a variable, but a constant).  Quotes can also be used to
 * search for GroundedPredicateNodes (since a quoted GPN will be
 * treated as a constant, and not as a function).  Quotes can be nested,
 * only the first quote is used to escape into the literal context,
 * and so quotes can be used to search for expressions containing
 * quotes.  It is assumed that the QuoteLink has an arity of one, as
 * its quite unclear what an arity of more than one could ever mean.
 *
 * That method have side effects. The main one is to insert variable
 * groundings (and in fact sub-clauses grounding as well) in
 * var_grounding when encountering variables (and sub-clauses) in the
 * pattern.

 * re-identifying the same clause over and over as unsolved.
 *
 * The words "solved" and "grounded" are used as synonyms through out
 * the code.
 *
 * Additional complications are introduced by the presence of
 * evaluatable terms, black-box terms, and optional clauses. An
 * evaluatable term is any term that needs to be evaluated to determine
 * if it matches: such terms typically do not exist in the atomspace;
 * they are "virtual", and "exist" only when the evaluation returns
 * "true". Thus, these can only be grounded after all other possible
 * clauses are grounded; thus these are saved for last.  It is always
 * possible to save these for last, because earlier stages have
 * guaranteed that all of the non-virtual clauses are connected.
 * Anyway, evaluatables come in two forms: those that can be evaluated
 * quickly, and those that require a "black-box" evaluation of some
 * scheme or python code. Of the two, we save "black-box" for last.
 *
 * Then, after grounding all of the mandatory clauses (virtual or not),
 * we look for optional clauses, if any. Again, these might be virtual,
 * and they might be black...
 *
 * Thus, we use a helper function to broaden the search in each case.
