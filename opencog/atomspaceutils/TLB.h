/**
 * Each atom stored in the AtomSpace will have an immutable UUID, which
 * may be used to refer to that atom when a reference to that atom needs
 * to be kept.  This allows atoms to be shared between different
 * atomspaces running in different memory spaces (on different machines
 * in a network cluster): a given atom will have a unique UUID by which
 * it is refered to.
 *
 * Atomspaces are also issued UUID's. This allows atomspaces to be
 * uniquely identified as well.
 *
 * Reserving UUID's is kind of like mallocing them, except that
 * (currently) there is no way to free them.  Use reserve_range()
 * and reserve_extent() to malloc them.
 *
 * Everything in this class is private, mostly because we don't want
 * anyone to mess with it, except our closest friends.
