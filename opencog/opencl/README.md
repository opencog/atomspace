OpenCL Scaffolding
==================
Experimental effort to target OpenCL

Version 0.0.1.

HOWTO
-----
Run the `opencog/opencl/scaffolding` executable from the build
directory. It will print a short-form hardware listing that should
match what the `clinfo` command lists.

Copy `hello.cl` to whatever directory you are running `scaffolding`
from.
