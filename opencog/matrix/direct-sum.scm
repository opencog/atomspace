; Define an API for taking the direct sum of two matrices.

; OVERVIEW
; --------
; Two matrices may share the same rows (row types), but have completely
; different columns (column types); it can be useful to work with a
; matrix that is the concatenation of these two, so that the combined
; matrix has rows that have entries from one, and from the other, as if
; the two matrices were stacked side-by-side.
;
; A protoypical example of the need for this the combination of a
; word-disjunct matrix with a shape matrix. A word-disjunct matrix has
; the form of `(Section (Word "left-item") (Disjunct ...))` where the
; Disjunct has Words inside of it. A shape matrix is similar, but this
; time isolating the Words in the Disjunct, and making them be the left
; item. Both matrices have the same type of left-item. Thus,
; concatenating them allows one left item to index a union of the
; right-items of the two matrices. Each row of this matrix is a vector,
; the concatenation of the corresponding rows in each matrix.
;
; More formally, this creates the direct sum of these two matrices,
; after taking the set-union of the left and the right indexes on
; the matrix.  This avoids any assumptions that the types of the
; indexes are the same, or are even compatible; it simply mashes them
; up to create a union-type.
;
; In index notation, if matrix D is the direct sum of matrix A and B,
; that is, if D = A ⊕ B, then the left basis of D is the set-union of
; the left basis of A and of B, and likewise the right-basis. The
; matrix elements D_ij are either A_ij or B_ij, depending on which one
; exists. It is generally assumed that either one or the other exists,
; but not both. It is ill-defined if both exist.
;
; More formally still, calling this thing a "direct sum" is an abuse of
; the formal defintion of a direct sum. In many ways, it resembles just
; an "ordinary sum" of two matrices. However, because this is enlarging
; the set of basis elements, it is not "just" the sum of two matrices.
; It is creating a new union type from the types of the two matrices;
; an ordinary sum normally requires that the types of the indexes be
; the same. There's no obvious formal term in mathematics that I know
; of, that would apply here. "Direct sum" seems close enough.

  direct-sum LLA LLB -- provide a matrix API for the 'sum' of A and B.

  This has aspects of being a concatenation of A and B, of being an
  'ordinary' sum of A and B, and of being a direct sum, .. kind-of.

  Given objects LLA and LLB, this presents a new object whose
  left-basis is the set-union of the left-basis of A and B, and
  likewise the right basis. The matrix elements are likewise the
  set-union; it is assumed that the matrix elements of A and B are
  *disjoint sets*, so that the union is well-defined. If they are
  not disjoint, then the behavior is ill-defined (i.e. it is not
  currently specified.)

  The current implementation also assumes that either the left-basis
  of A and B are disjoint, or that the right-basis is. The current
  design of this whole module makes it kind-of hard if not impossible
  for this not to be the case. So this is a reasonable assumption.
