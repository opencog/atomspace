; OVERVIEW
; --------
; The scripts below compute the mutual information held in pairs
; of "items".  The "items" can be any atoms, arranged in ordered pairs,
; usually by a ListLink. For example,
;
;     ListLink
;          SomeAtom "left-side"
;          OtherKinfOfAtom "right-hand-part"
;
; It is presumed that the atomspace already contains such pairs, with
; counts attached to each. The prototypical example is a word-pair,
; connected with an "ANY" link-grammar link:
;
;   EvaluationLink
;      LinkGrammarRelationshipNode "ANY"
;      ListLink
;         WordNode "some-word"
;         WordNode "other-word"
;
; In the general case, access to this structure is provided by methods
; on the "low-level API". These include:
;   'left-type and 'right-type, both of which should return 'WordNode
;         for the above.
;   'get-pair, which should return the EvaluationLink, given the
;        ListLink
;   'left-wildcard and 'right-wildcard, indicating where the partial
;        sums, such as N(x,*) and N(*,y) should be stored.
;
; Let N(wl,wr) denote the number of times that the pair (wl, wr) has
; actually been observed; that is, N("some-word", "other-word") for the
; example above.  Properly speaking, this count is conditioned on the
; LinkGrammarRelationshipNode "ANY", so the correct notation would be
; N(rel, wl, wr) with `rel` the relationship.  In what follows, the
; relationship is always assumed to be the same, and is thus dropped.
; (the relationship is provided through the GET-PAIR function).
;
; The mutual information for a pair is defined as follows:  Given
; two items, wl and wr, define three probabilities:
;
;    P(wl,wr) = N(wl,wr) / N(*,*)
;    P(wl,*)  = N(wl,*)  / N(*,*)
;    P(*,wr)  = N(*,wr)  / N(*,*)
;
; The N(*,*), N(wl,*) and  N(*,wr) are wild-card counts, and are defined
; to be sums over all observed left and right counts.  That is,
;
;    N(wl,*) = Sum_wr N(wl,wr)
;    N(*,wr) = Sum_wl N(wl,wr)
;    N(*,*) = Sum_wl Sum_wr N(wl,wr)
;
; Given an object containing the raw counts N(wl,wr), these sums are
; computed by the `add-support-compute` object. Because these take
; considerable CPU time to compute, the resulting values are cached,
; and can be obtained with the `add-support-api` object. (This is
; typical throughout the code: there are pairs of objects, one which
; computes marginals, and another that accesses the cached values.)
;
; For example, for word-pair counts, the wild-card sums are stored
; with the atoms
;
;   EvaluationLink
;      LinkGrammarRelationshipNode "ANY"
;      ListLink
;         AnyNode "left-word"
;         WordNode "bird"
;
;   EvaluationLink
;      LinkGrammarRelationshipNode "ANY"
;      ListLink
;         WordNode "word"
;         AnyNode "right-word"
;
;   EvaluationLink
;      LinkGrammarRelationshipNode "ANY"
;      ListLink
;         AnyNode "left-word"
;         AnyNode "right-word"
;
; Here, AnyNode plays the role of *.  Thus, N(*,*) is shorthand for the
; last of these triples.
;
; After they've been computed, the values for N(*,y) and N(x,*) can be
; fetched with the 'left-count and 'right-count methods on the
; support-api object.  The value for N(*,*) can be gotten with the
; 'wild-wild-count method. More correctly, there are two of these
; totals, which should differ only by rounding errors: they differ in
; the order in which the sums are performed.
;
; The fractional mutual information for the pair (x,y) is defined with
; a plus sign, as in Deniz Yuret's thesis (1998, page 40):
;
;     MI(x,y) = + log_2 [ p(x,y) /  p(x,*) p(*,y) ]
;
; This is computed by the script batch-all-pair-mi below. The value is
; attached at the location provided by the 'set-pair-mi method on the
; object.  It can later be retrieved with the corresponding 'pair-mi
; method.
;
; The main utility wrapper not only computes all of these, but also
; stores them in the database, from which they can be retrieved at some
; future date.  This helps avoid repeating the calculation, which can
; take many hours for large datasets (tens of millions of pairs).

  batch-all-pair-mi LLOBJ [DO-STORE]

  Compute the mutual information between all pairs. Counts, frequencies
  and left, right partial sums are also performed; this is an all-in-one
  routine, which computes all of the needed pre-requisites, and stores
  them, as well as the MI, in the database.

  The mutual information between pairs is described in the overview,
  up top of this file. The access to the pairs is governed by the
  the methods on the passed object.

  Among the things that are computed and stored are the partial sums
  of counts, i.e. the N(x,*) and N(*,y) explained up top, the total
  count N(*,*), the frequencies p(x,y) = N(x,y) / N(*,*), the
  corresponding partial sums.  All of these quantities are written
  back to the database, at the time of computation.

  In order to work correctly, this function assumes that the object
  has at least the minimal low-level API to identify where to find
  the counts on pairs.  This script is designed to work with any kinds
  of pairs.

  Running this script can take hours or longer, depending on the size
  of the dataset. Progress reports are printed to stdout, including
  timing and summary statistics. This script wasn't really designed to
  be efficient; instead, the goal to to allow general, generic knowledge
  representation.  You can compute MI between any kinds of things
  If you just need to count one thing, writing custom scripts that do
  NOT use the atomspace would almost surely be faster.  We put up with
  the performance overhead here in order to get the flexibility that
  the atomspace provides.

  By default, the results of the computation are stored in the currently
  open database. If the optional argument DO-STORE is set to #f, then
  the storage will not be performed.
