; OVERVIEW
; --------
; Given a word, and a vector attached to that word, one can compute a
; symmetric mutual-information (MI) value betweem two words. In the
; typical example, the vector consists of counts observed on disjuncts
; associated to that word (although it could be any vector).
;
; This file precomputes the various partial sums (marginals) that occur
; in the definition of the symmetric MI.  It assumes that the vectors
; (i.e. observation counts) are in an open database; it fetches those,
; computes the assorted marginals, and writes those marginals back to
; disk. Specifically, the marginals are those needed for the
; `transpose-api`, which is used to compute the symmetric MI.
;
; REVIEW
; ------
; The symmetric-MI is described in the diary. What follows is a quick
; review that motivates the stuff in this file.
;
; One has numbers (observation counts) `N(w,d)` which count the number
; of times that disjuct `d` was observed on word `w`.  These numbers
; define a vector on the word `w`. Given two words `w` and `u`, one
; may define the vector dot-product between them as:
;
;      S(u,w) = sum_d N(u,d) N(w,d)
;
; Note that this product is symmetric: S(u,w) = S(w,u)
; Note that this product underlies the definition of the cosine between
; the two vectors.  The cosine is just
;
;     cos(u,w) = S(u,w) / sqrt (S(u,u) S(w,w))
;
; This product can also be used to define a symmetric mutual
; information between the words:
;
;     MI(u,w) = log_2 S(u,w) S(*,*) / S(u,*) S(w,*)
;
; where, as usual, the star * defines a wild-card sum:
;
;     S(u,*) = S(*,u) = sum_w S(u,w)
;
; The above follows because one can interpret
;
;     P(u,w) = S(u,w) / S(*,*)
;
; as a probability of observing the pair (u,w).  All the usual notions
; of probability then ensue, and MI(u,w) is just the usual definition
; of the (symmetric) mutual information.
;
; Note that S(u,w) can itself be thought of as a matrix; it is a product
; of N times its transpose.  That is, let [N] denote the matrix whose
; matrix elements are N(w,d), and [S] be thw matrix whose matrix
; elements are S(u,w). Then one has that
;
;    [S] = [N][N]^T
;
; where [N]^T is the matrix-transpose, i.e. is the matrix whose matrix
; elements are N^T(d,w)=N(w,d).
;
; COMPUTATIONS
; ------------
; The definition of MI(u,w) above requires the partial sums for S(u,*)
; and S(*,*). These can be fetched from the atomspace by the
; `add-transpose-api` matrix class. But, to be fetched, they need to
; first be precomputed by the `add-transpose-compute` matrix class.
; This class, in turn relies on the `add-support-api` class, which
; requires that the support marginals were previously computed by the
; `add-support-compute` class.  Thus, this does all the bulk
; calculations that generate these marginals, and then stores them back
; to disk.
;
; Note that the scripts here are specifically tailored to doing just
; one "side" of the computation: viz, only [N][N]^T or only [N]^T[N].
; That is because typically, one is interested only in the one, or
; in the other, but not both. Computing both takes a lot more CPU time.
; Even worse, the number of disjuncts `d` far exceeds the number of
; words `w`, by more than an order of magnitude, and sometimes two,
; and so the sizes of these matrixes are vastly different, and the
; resulting computations waste not only CPU but also RAM and storage.
; Thus, one "side" at a time can be computed.

; Example usage
;
; This creates the marginals needed to obtain the symmetric MI between
; words that are attached to disjunct vectors.
;
; (define pca (make-psuedo-cset-api))
; (define btp (batch-transpose pca))
; (btp 'mmt-marginals)
;
; Now make use of the above....
; (define tca (add-transpose-api pca))
; (tca 'mmt-count (Word "eyes"))
;
; This creates the marginals needed to obtain the symmetric MI between
; words that appear inside of connectors. This splurges on the left
; wild-cards, because there are so many possibilities.
;
; (define cva (make-connector-vec-api))
; (define cvs (add-pair-stars cva))
; (define cvp (add-support-api cvs))
; (define btc (batch-transpose cva))
; (btc 'mmt-marginals)
;
; However, word-counts need the right marginals:
; (btc 'right-marginals)
