; OVERVIEW
; --------
; Large datasets are inherently likely to contain "noise" and spurious
; data that might be unwanted during data analysis. For example, the
; dataset might contain a large number of atoms that were observed only
; once or twice; these are likely to be junk and should be removed
; before data analysis begins.
;
; The code here provides this filtering ability. Several types of
; filters are provided:
; -- a knockout filter, that knocks out designated rows and columns.
; -- a min-count filter, that knocks out rows and columns whose
;    marginal counts are below a minimum, as well as individual matrix
;    entries that are below a per-entry minimum.
; -- a generic callback-defined filter, that knocks out rows, columns
;    and individual entries based on callback predicates.
;
; Note that these filters are all "on demand": they do NOT copy the
; dataset and then compute a smaller version of it.  Instead, they
; overload the "star" API, altering the methods used to fetch rows,
; columns and individual entries.  Since all the other matrix access
; routines use the "star" API to gain access to the matrix and it's
; marginals, this works!

"
  add-generic-filter LLOBJ - Modify LLOBJ so that only the columns and
  rows and individual entries that satisfy the predicates are retained.

  This provides the same methods as the `add-pair-stars` object; it is
  a replacement of that object, for all practical purposes. Thus, given
  some matrix, this object provides a way of accessing a smaller,
  lower-dimensional version of that matrix, by knocking out rows,
  columns and individual entries.

  Note, however, that the full-sized matrix will typically have
  marginals associated with it (such as totals over columns and rows)
  and that those marginals will typically become invalid for the
  smaller matrix (because totals over columns and rows for the smaller
  matrix are necessarily different). This filter does NOT attempt to
  recompute those marginals!  It is up  to the user to track these!
  The ID-STR can be used to give this submatrix a unique name, and
  therefore can be used as a tag, when recomputing marginals for the
  smaller matrix.

  The LEFT-BASIS-PRED and RIGHT-BASIS-PRED should be functions that
  accept atoms in the left and right basis, and return #t if they
  should be kept. If these predicates return #f, that row or column
  will not appear in the filtered matrix.

  The PAIR-PRED should be a function to that accepts individual matrix
  entries. It is applied whenever the 'get-pair or 'get-count methods
  are invoked.  Like the others, it should return #t to keep the pair.

  The ID-STR should be a string; it is appended to the dataset name and
  id, so that unique identifier names can be constructed for each
  filtered dataset.

  The RENAME argument should be #f or #t, it is used to determine how
  other API's generate predicate keys to obtain values.

(define-public (add-subtotal-filter LLOBJ LEFT-CUT RIGHT-CUT PAIR-CUT RENAME)
"
  add-subtotal-filter LLOBJ - Modify LLOBJ so that any columns and
  rows with counts less than LEFT-CUT and RIGHT-CUT are removed, and that
  individual entries with counts less than PAIR-CUT are removed. This
  provides an API compatible with the star-object API; i.e. it provides
  the same row and column addressability that star-object does, but
  just returns fewer rows, columns and individual entries.

  The filtering is done 'on demand', on a row-by-row, column-by-column
  basis.  Computations of the left and right stars are cached, so that
  they are not recomputed for each request.

  Note that by removing rows and columns, the frequencies that were
  computed for the entire matrix will no longer sum to 1.0 for the
  filtered submatrix.  Likewise, row and column subtotals, and any
  marginals will no longer sum or behave as in the whole dataset.
  If accurate values for these are needed, then they would need to
  be recomputed for the reduced matrix. The 'filters? method, and
  the RENAME argument provide a way for dealing with this.

  If the RENAME argument is #t, then the other various API's will use
  a special key name, created from the 'id of this filter, to access
  frequencies and marginals. This allows filtered frequencies and
  marginals to be stored within the same matrix.  If the RENAME
  argument is #f, then all access to the frequencies and marginals
  will be through the primary, main predicate keys.

  Thus, set RENAME to #f if you just want to cut down on the number of
  rows and columns, but otherwise use the normal data.  But if you need
  to recompute new values and marginals for the filtered matrix, then
  set RENAME to #t.

  Some terminology: Let N(x,y) be the observed count for the pair (x,y).
  Let N(*,y) be the column subtotals, AKA the left-subtotals.
  Let N(x,*) be the row subtotals, AKA the right subtotals.

  This object removes all columns where  N(*,y) <= RIGHT-CUT and all
  rows where N(x,*) <= LEFT-CUT.  Pairs are not reported in the
  'left-stars and 'right-stars methods when N(x,y) <= PAIR-CUT.
  Likewise, duals are not reported when the corresponding pair fails
  the PAIR-CUT.

  The net effect of the cuts is that when LEFT-CUT is increased, the
  left-dimension of the dataset drops; likewise on the right.

  The filtering is done 'on demand', on a row-by-row, column-by-column

  Note that by removing entries, the effective FMI, and the entropy
  subtotals will no longer obey the relationships used to originally
