  add-support-api LLOBJ ID - Extend LLOBJ with methods to retrieve
  support, count and length subtotals on rows and columns. It is assumed
  that these have been previously computed, as described below.

  See the documentation on `add-support-compute` for precise definitions
  of \"support\", \"count\" and \"length\"; in brief, these are just the
  l_0, l_1 and l_2 norms of the rows and columns.

  This object provides per-row/per-column values for support, count and
  length.  The `add-report-api` has methods with similar, or the same
  names, but it provides matrix-wide averages (i.e. averaged over all
  rows and columns).

  This object fetches precomputed values, fetched from the \"margins\"
  of the matrix (i.e. attached to the matrix wild-cards.) These marginal
  values must have been previously computed and attached to the wildcards.
  This can be done by saying
     `((add-support-compute LLOBJ) 'cache-all)`
  The `add-support-api` and `add-support-compute` API's are designed
  to work together and complement one-another.

  Optional argument ID is #f to use the default value key; otherwise
  a filtered key is used. That is, the marginals are fetched from a
  default location; however, that location can be changed by specifying
  it with the optional ID argument.

"
  add-support-compute LLOBJ - Extend LLOBJ with methods to
  compute wild-card sums, including the support (lp-norm for p=0),
  the count (lp-norm for p=1), the Euclidean length (lp-norm for p=2)
  and the general lp-norm.  By default, these are computed from the
  counts on the matrix; optionally, a different source of numbers can
  be used.  This object does not make use of any pre-computed (marginal
  or \"cached\") values; instead, all computations are done on the raw
  matrix data.  The computed norms are not placed back into the
  atomspace after being computed (unless the 'cache-all method is
  invoked, in which case a bulk computation is done.) Cached values
  can be access with the `add-support-api` object.

  This object provides per-row/per-column values for these quantities.
  The `make-central-compute` object has methods with similar or the
  same names; they provide the matrix-wide averages.

  The 'cache-all method computes norms for the ENTIRE matrix, and
  places them in the margins, i.e. as values on the wild-cards of the
  matrix.  This can take a lot of CPU-time. After the 'cache-all
  method has been invoked, the `(add-support-api)` object can be
  used to access these values.

  In order for 'cache-all to work, the full matrix must available
  in RAM.  It can be fetched by calling `(LLOBJ 'fetch-pairs)`.
  After computing the marginals, it is wise to store them back to
  disk. This can be done with `((make-store LLOBJ) 'store-wildcards)`

  Some terminology: Let N(x,y) be the observed count for the pair (x,y).
  Let D(x,y) == 1 if N(x,y) > 0; otherwise D(x,y) == 0.

  The 'left-support-set method return all pairs (x,y), for fixed y, for
  which N(x,y) > 0. The right-support-set is the same, for fixed x.

  The support is the size of the support-set.  AKA the l_0 norm.
  The 'left-support is the number of non-zero entries in a column.
  That is, the left-support is D(*,y) = sum_x D(x,y)

  The 'left-count is the wild-card N(*,y) = sum_x N(x,y) for fixed y.
  That is, for a given column y, this sums all counts in that column.

  The 'left-length is sqrt(sum_x N^2(x,y)) for fixed y.

  The 'left-lp-norm is |sum_x N^p(x,y)|^1/p for fixed y.

  The 'total-support is sum_x sum_y D(x,y)
  That is, the total number of non-zero entries in the matrix.

  The 'total-count-left is N(*,*) = sum_x N(x,*)
  That is, the total of all count entries in the matrix, with the
  left-sum being done last. It uses the cached, previously-computed
  right-marginal sums N(x,*) to perform the computation, and so this
  computation will fail, if the marginals have not been stored.

  The 'total-count-right is N(*,*) = sum_y N(*,y)
  Same as above, but does the right-sum last. Should yeild the same
  answer, as above, except for rounding errors. Using this method can
  be more convenient, if the right-marginal sums are not available
  (and v.v. if the other marginals are not available.)

  The 'set-left-marginals ITEM requires an argument ITEM from the
  right basis. It computes the marginals for that ITEM and caches
  them.  This is useful when some algorithm has modified the matrix,
  and the marginals for a specific column need to be recomputed.

  The 'set-right-marginals ITEM requires an argument ITEM from the
  left basis. It computes the marginals for that ITEM and caches them.
  This is useful when some algorithm has modified the matrix, and the
  marginals for a specific row need to be recomputed.

  Here, the LLOBJ is expected to be an object, with valid counts
  associated with each pair. LLOBJ is expected to have working,
  functional methods for 'left-type and 'right-type on it.

  By default, the N(x,y) is taken to be the 'get-count method on LLOBJ,
  i.e. it is literally the count. The optional argument GET-CNT allows
  this to be over-ridden with any other method that returns a number.
  For example, to compute the lengths and norms for frequencies, simply
  pass 'pair-freq as the second argument: Any method that takes a pair
  and returns a number is allowed.
