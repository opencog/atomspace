/// The DefineLink is used to give a name to a hypergraph (schema,
/// pattern, concept, predicate, etc).  The DefineLink is unique, in
/// that, if any other atoms exists with this same name, it will throw
/// an error!  Thus, only ONE DefineLink with a given name can exist
/// at a time.
///
/// This class is intended to be used for anything that needs to be
/// accessed by name: for, if there were two things with the same name,
/// it would be ambiguous as to which to access. (It would not make
/// sense to access both: would the result of access have 'and'
/// semantics? 'or' semantics ??)  Thus, this exists to define an atom
/// uniquely.
///
/// The only place where I know of, at the moment, for this beast, is
/// for the construction of recursive patterns, as that is the only
/// place where a simple cut-n-paste is insufficient to specify what
/// comes next.
///
/// It is intended that the DefineLink be used with the ComposeLink,
/// which provides the values for the variables bound by the DefineLink.
/// That is, the ComposeLink acts like function composition. It does not
/// actually call, invoke or ground the resulting composition.
///
/// Currently, the implementation of ComposeLink is half-finished and
/// mostly broken.
