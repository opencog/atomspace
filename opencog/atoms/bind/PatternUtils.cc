/**
 * Remove constant clauses from the list of clauses.
 *
 * Make sure that every clause contains at least one variable;
 * if not, remove the clause from the list of clauses.
 *
 * The core idea is that pattern matching against a constant expression
 * "doesn't make sense" -- the constant expression will always match to
 * itself and is thus "trivial".  In principle, the programmer should
 * never include constants in the list of clauses ... but, due to
 * programmer error, this can happen, and will lead to failures during
 * pattern matching. Thus, the routine below can be used to validate
 * the input.
 *
 * Terms that contain GroundedSchema or GroundedPrecdicate nodes can
 * have side-effects, and are thus not really constants. They must be
 * evaluated during the pattern search.
 *
 * Returns true if the list of clauses was modified, else returns false.

/**
 * Given an input set of clauses, partition this set into its
 * connected components, returning a list of the connected components,
 * and a matching list of the variables that appear in each component.
 * The input set of clauses are assumed to be in conjunctive normal
 * form; i.e. they do NOT contain any OrLinks. If they do, then you
 * must used the `get_disjoined_components()` function, below.
 *
 * Two clauses are "connected" if they both contain a common
 * variable. A connected component is the set of all clauses that are
 * connected to one-another, in some way.
 *
 * This method serves two different purposes.  First, if the
 * pattern does not contain any "virtual" links, then the pattern
 * matcher works correctly only if there is one single, connected
 * component (this is by design, since we don't want to deal with
 * the combinatoric explosion of grounding multuple distinct components).
 * If the pattern does contain "virtual" links, then the connected
 * components should be grounded first, and the results then combined
 * by exploring the combinatoric possibilites presented by the virtual
 * link(s).
 *
 * A side effect of the algorithm is that it sorts the clauses into
 * connected order. That is, given the vector of connected clauses,
 * each element in the vector is connected to some clause that came
 * before it (in the vector).  This is handy, because it guarantees
 * that the next clause must be connected to the previous ones. This
 * speeds up the discovery of the next ungrounded clause: it is
 * trivially just the very next clause in the connected set.  Of
 * course, users will typically never specify clauses in such order.
