/// reduce() -- reduce the expression by summing constants, etc.
///
/// No actual black-box evaluation or execution is performed. Only
/// clearbox reductions are performed.
///
/// Examples: the reduct of (FoldLink (NumberNode 2) (NumberNode 2))
/// is (NumberNode 4) -- its just a constant.
///
/// The reduct of (FoldLink (VariableNode "$x") (NumberNode 0)) is
/// (VariableNode "$x"), because adding zero to anything yeilds the
/// thing itself.
///
/// This routine is pretending to be more general, though, than simply
/// reducing numeric expressions.  It makes the following assumptions
/// and performs the following actions:
///
/// 1) It is always safe to remove knil from a list. That is, knil is
///    always a unit.
/// 2) Two neighboring elements of the same type can always be kons'ed
///    together with each-other.  That is, kons is called on two
///    neighbors that have the same type. That is, this assumes that
///    the list has the associative property, so that neighboring
///    elements can always be cons'ed together.
/// 3) It does not asssume the commutative property.
/// 4) If distributive_type is set, then kons is called when it seems
///    that one neigboring element might distribute into the next.
///    This is vaguely hacky, and is used to implement distributivity
///    of multiplication over addition.
///
/// For something as simple as the above, the code below is
/// annoyingly complicated.  This is certainly not an efficient,
/// effective way to build a computer algebra system.  It works, its
/// just barely good enough for single-variable arithmetic, but that's
/// all.  For general reduction tasks, there are two choices:
///
/// A) Convert atoms to some other CAS format, reduce that, and then
///    convert back to atoms.
///
/// B) Figure out why the atomspace is so ungainly, and fix it so that
///    it is both easy (easier) to use, and also is high-performance.
///
/// Obviously, B) is much harder than A) but is probably more important.
