/**
 * The PatternTerm class is used to provide a "context" for an atom.
 * This context is used to determine if the atom is quoted or not.
 * That is, whether any atom may be quoted or not quoted depends on
 * the holders of that atom.  Context is also required if a given
 * atom appears in multiple locations in a pattern, especially if
 * those locations are in unordered links. This additional context
 * is needed to traverse unordered links correctly.
 *
 * Pattern trees are converted to PatternTerm trees during pattern
 * pre-processing.  For a given query pattern, specified as an atom, an
 * equivalent PatternTerm tree is constructed.  The PatternTerm tree
 * differs from the original tree in that any atom that appears two or
 * more times in the query is "disambiguated", and given a distinct,
 * unique PatternTerm that corresponds to it.  Thus, each instance of
 * PatternTerm corresponds to one atom in at one fixed location in the
 * pattern.  That is, the relation between instances of PatternTerm and
 * atoms is many-to-one, because a given atom may occur in the pattern
 * in several positions.
 *
 * For example, given the query
 *    SetLink
 *        VariableNode $a
 *        BlahBlahLink
 *             VariableNode $a
 *             VariableNode $b
 *
 * The VariableNode $a occurs twice, in two different locations. Each
 * location will get it's own unique instance of PatternTerm.
 *
 * For a given term in the pattern, the _handle attribute points to the
 * corresponding atom of the query.  Roots of the PatternTerm trees
 * reference the roots of query clauses. Term tree roots have its
 * _parent attributes UNDEFINED.
 *
 * Term trees are build in the course of preprocessing stage before
 * pattern matcher starts searching for variable groundings. Each
 * clause is then recursively traversed from the root downwards,
 * through outgoing atoms. The _outgoing attribute stores a list of
 * the children created during this traversal. It corresponds
 * one-to-one to outgoing sets of the referenced atom.
