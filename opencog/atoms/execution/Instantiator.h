 * Given an ungrounded expression (i.e. an expression containing variables)
 * and a map between variables and ground terms, it will create a new
 * expression, with the ground terms substituted for the variables.
 *
 * This also implements generic execution: any executable links are
 * executed as the variable substitution is performed.  In particular,
