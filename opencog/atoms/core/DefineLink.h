/// The DefineLink is used to give a name to a hypergraph (schema,
/// pattern, concept, predicate, etc).  The name is unique, in that,
/// any attempt to make a different definition with the same name will
/// throw an error.  Thus, only ONE DefineLink with a given name can
/// exist at a time.
///
/// This class is intended to be used for anything that needs to be
/// accessed by name: for, if there were two things with the same name,
/// it would be ambiguous as to which to access. (It would not make
/// sense to access both: would the result of access have 'and'
/// semantics? 'or' semantics ??)  Thus, names are unique.
///
/// This is useful for three different purposes. These are:
/// -- The definition of new predicates and schemas. Yes, the 
///    EquivalenceLink could be used for this; but right now, we are
///    experimenting with DefineLink.
/// -- A programmer/use convenience. Handy for tagging some atom with
///    a name, and then referring to that atom by it's name, later on.
/// -- Enabling recursion. A definition can occur within itself, and
///    can thus specify an infinitely-recursive pattern.  When evaluated
///    or executed, this inifinite pattern must, of course terminate,
///    or your code will hang.  Bummer if your code hangs.
///
/// Of the three, the last is the most important, as, right now, there
/// is no other way of specifying recursive functions in the atomspace.
