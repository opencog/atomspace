/**
 * The FunctionLink provides an important method: execute().
 * The execute() method executes the given expression, and returns
 * a Handle resulting from the execution.
 *
 * The FunctionLink is meant to be a base class for any link type
 * that behaves like a function; i.e. can be executed.  Observe that
 * it derives from the FreeLink, and NOT the LambdaLink.  This may seem
 * counter-intuitive, and deserves an explanation, so here it is:
 * All link types inheriting from this class will always, by definition,
 * have thier outgoing set be the arguments to that function. Think of
 * PlusLink, for example.  Having a lambda with variable declarations
 * in there would just be weird and create confusion.  If the arguments
 * to PlusLink happen to include a variable, that variable is necessarily
 * free; thus, this class dervies from FreeLink.
 *
 * Note that this class must NOT be used for user-defined functions;
 * users should use the LambdaLink for that.
