// A FreeLink is any kind of link that might have free variables in it.
// The FreeLink exists for one purpose: to make visible/explicit all of

// That is, envision the FreeLink as being at the top of a tree, and
// somewhere in that tree, there might be VariableNodes.  The C++ class
// for this link records the names of those variables, in order of
// traversal.  The goal here is to simply know these variables, so that,
// at the time of evaluation or execution, they are easily located.
//
// The variables are necessarily free: they do NOT have type
// declarations or restrictions associated with them.  This is in sharp
// contrast to ScopeLink, which binds variables by scoping them, and
// then forcing type restrictions to them.
//
// FreeLinks may be open or closed; they are closed terms if they
// have no free variables in them.
//

// Implementation Note: The DeleteLink cannot inherit from FunctionLink
// because that would cause all variables to be bound, i.e. to become
// a closed sentence; thus it inherits from FreeLink.
//
DELETE_LINK <- FREE_LINK

// Only one "closed" UniqueLink may exist (in the atomspace), for a
// fixed first atom of the link.  Useful for defining state.  Additional

// body; those that are not bound remain free.
//
// The ScopeLink differs from the FreeLink in that the FreeLink
// necessarily list ALL the (free) variables within it; the ScopeLink
// need not bind all of them.  The FreeLink also has no type
// restrictions on the variables.
//
// The ScopeLink differs from a LambdaLink in that it does NOT allow
