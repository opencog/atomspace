// The alternatives are just that: alternatives. They are not true/false
// valued; they're simply options on a menu. Pick one.  It is an ordered

// The ChoiceLink is NOT semantically equivalent to the OrLink. The

DONT_EXEC_LINK <- ORDERED_LINK

// A FreeLink is any kind of link that might have free variables in it.
// The FreeLink exists for one purpose: to make visible/explicit all of
// free variables in the link. The primary user is the pattern matcher.
// That is, envision the FreeLink as being at the top of a tree, and
// somewhere in that tree, there might be VariableNodes.  The C++ class
// for this link records the names of those variables, in order of
// traversal.  The goal here is to simply know these variables, so that,
// at the time of evaluation or execution, they are easily located.
//
// The variables are necessarily free: they do NOT have type
// declarations or restrictions associated with them.  This is in sharp
// contrast to ScopeLink, which binds variables by scoping them, and
// then forcing type restrictions to them.
//
// FreeLinks may be open or closed; they are closed terms if they
// have no free variables in them.
//
FREE_LINK <- ORDERED_LINK

// See wikipedia for a formal defintion).
//
// Attempting to insert a DeleteLink holding a fully grounded term
// (holding a closed sentence) will instead cause the the term to be

// grounded term is deleted.
//
// Implementation Note: The DeleteLink cannot inherit from FunctionLink
// because that would cause all variables to be bound, i.e. to become
// a closed sentence; thus it inherits from FreeLink.
//
DELETE_LINK <- FREE_LINK

// Only one "closed" UniqueLink may exist (in the atomspace), for a
// fixed first atom of the link.  Useful for defining state.  Additional

// body; those that are not bound remain free.
//
// The ScopeLink differs from the FreeLink in that the FreeLink

// need not bind all of them.  The FreeLink also has no type
// restrictions on the variables.
SCOPE_LINK <- ORDERED_LINK

// The RewriteLink is a ScopeLink with extra methods that perform

// like LambdaLink ... it isn't.  Not everything is a Lambda.
REWRITE_LINK <- SCOPE_LINK

// The PrenexLink is a RewriteLink that maintains prenex normal form.
// It serves as a base class for the various pattern-matching links,

// since function composition in atomese only seems to make sense if
// the result is in prenex form. (I can't figure out the meaning,

PRENEX_LINK <- REWRITE_LINK

// The LambdaLink is supposed to roughly model the traditional concept
// of a lambda from lambda calculus (or functional programming). It
// is meant to behave just like a lambda-abstraction, and supports the
// standard operations of beta-reduction and alpha-conversion (modulo
// that the atomspace enforces alpha-equivalence).  Non-prenex lambdas
// in atomese don't seem to "make any sense", at least to me, so
// lambda's are forced to be prenex. This is a departure from classical
