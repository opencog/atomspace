// the alternatives. The alternatives are just that: alternatives.
// They are not true/false valued; they're simply options on a menu.
// Pick one.  It is an ordered link, in the sense that the first choice
// might be preferable.
//
// The ChoiceLink is NOT semantically equivalent to the OrLink. The
// OrLink of two sets is a set union. The ChoiceLink of two sets is
// "pick one of these two sets but not both". (So its more like

// This is important for the pattern matcher; you use it to say

// we currently do not check to make sure that each Unquote has a Quote
// above it. We should ...)
UNQUOTE_LINK <- ORDERED_LINK

// QuoteLink and each atom of the its outgoing set with an UnquoteLink.
LOCAL_QUOTE_LINK <- ORDERED_LINK

// Everything under a DontExecLink is not executed. This is typically

DONT_EXEC_LINK <- ORDERED_LINK

// A FreeLink is any kind of link that might have free variables in it.
// The FreeLink exists for one purpose: to make visible/explicit all of
// free variables in the link. The primary user is the pattern matcher.
// That is, envision the FreeLink as being at the top of a tree, and
// somewhere in that tree, there might be VariableNodes.  The C++ class
// for this link records the names of those variables, in order of
// traversal.  The goal here is to simply know these variables, so that,
// at the time of evaluation or execution, they are easily located.
//
// The variables are necessarily free: they do NOT have type
// declarations or restrictions associated with them.  This is in sharp
// contrast to ScopeLink, which binds variables by scoping them, and
// then forcing type restrictions to them.
//
// FreeLinks may be open or closed; they are closed terms if they
// have no free variables in them.
//
FREE_LINK <- ORDERED_LINK

// This is an interesting one. It is a link that must never be grounded!
// It must contain at least one VariableNode somewhere within it; that
// is, it must be an "open sentence" and never a "closed sentence".
// (as it would be called, using the terminology of predicate logic;
// See Wikipedia for a formal definition).
//
// Attempting to insert a DeleteLink holding a fully grounded term
// (holding a closed sentence) will instead cause the the term to be
// deleted from the AtomSpace, thus the name.  This is meant to be used
// with the pattern matcher, so that if it discovers a grounding, the
// grounded term is deleted.
//
// Implementation Note: The DeleteLink cannot inherit from FunctionLink
// because that would cause all variables to be bound, i.e. to become
// a closed sentence; thus it inherits from FreeLink.
//
DELETE_LINK <- FREE_LINK

// Only one "closed" UniqueLink may exist (in the AtomSpace), for a
// fixed first atom of the link.  Useful for defining state.  Additional
// "open" links may exist; "open" links are defined as links that
// contain free variables (see Wikipedia definition of "open term",
// "closed term").  Kind of like DeleteLink, but allows one instead of
// zero closed terms.
UNIQUE_LINK <- FREE_LINK

// Inserting a StateLink into the AtomSpace causes the previous

DEFINE_LINK <- UNIQUE_LINK

// The ScopeLink is used to identify an open term, i.e. a link
// containing VariableNodes within it, and binding those variables.
// In the process, it can also force type restrictions on them.
// The ScopeLink does not have to bind all variables that occur in it's
// body; those that are not bound remain free.
//
// The ScopeLink differs from the FreeLink in that the FreeLink
// necessarily lists ALL the (free) variables within it; the ScopeLink
// tracks only the bound variables (and not the free ones). The
// FreeLink cannot have type restrictions on the variables; the
// ScopeLink can (and usually does).
SCOPE_LINK <- ORDERED_LINK

// The RewriteLink is a ScopeLink with extra methods that perform
// alpha conversion and beta reduction on the ScopeLink. It is a base
// class for many kinds of atom types, most of which CANNOT be treated
// as if they were lambdas!  So user beware: although RewriteLink feels
// like LambdaLink ... it isn't.  Not everything is a Lambda.
REWRITE_LINK <- SCOPE_LINK

// The PrenexLink is a RewriteLink that maintains prenex normal form.
// It serves as a base class for the various pattern-matching links,
// since pattern matching only makes sense when the patterns are written
// in prenex normal form.  It also serves as the base class for Lambda,
// since function composition in Atomese only seems to make sense if
// the result is in prenex form. (I can't figure out what it means to
// have a Lambda that is not in prenex form. Or a Pattern that is not
// in prenex form.)
PRENEX_LINK <- REWRITE_LINK

// The LambdaLink is supposed to roughly model the traditional concept
// of a lambda from lambda calculus (or functional programming). It
// is meant to behave just like a lambda-abstraction, and supports the
// standard operations of beta-reduction and alpha-conversion (modulo
// that the AtomSpace enforces alpha-equivalence).  Non-prenex lambdas
// in Atomese don't seem to "make any sense", at least to me, so
// lambda's are forced to be prenex. This is a departure from classical
// lambda calculus.

// The PatternLink implements the base class holding a pattern that

// pattern.
PATTERN_LINK <- PRENEX_LINK

// Relations. A "relation" is a subset of a Cartesian product, or more

// Relations always have an associated subobject classifier. For naive

// A VirtualLink is equivalent to an EvaluationLink, with a

// pullback functor of sets over an object -- that is, the pullback
// functor on the slice category, where the slice is given by a
// PredicateNode.
