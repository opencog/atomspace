 cog-open STORAGE-ATOM

    Open a connection to the indicated STORAGE-ATOM. An open connection
    allows Atoms to be sent/received along this connection.

    Examples:
       (cog-open (PostgresStorage \"postgres:///example-db?user=foo&password=bar\"))
       (cog-open (RocksStorage \"rocks:///tmp/my-rocks-db\"))
       (cog-open (CogserverStorage \"cog://localhost:17001\"))

    See also:
       `cog-close` to close a connection.

(set-procedure-property! cog-close 'documentation
"
 cog-close STORAGE-ATOM

    Close an open connection to the indicated STORAGE-ATOM. Closing the
    connection disables further communication on the connection. The
    STORAGE-ATOM indicates which connection to close.

    Examples:
       (cog-close (PostgresStorage \"postgres:///example-db?user=foo&password=bar\"))
       (cog-close (RocksStorage \"rocks:///tmp/my-rocks-db\"))

 load-atomspace [STORAGE] - load all atoms from storage.

    This will cause ALL of the atoms in the open storage server to be

    operation.  In normal operation, it is rarely necessary to load all
    atoms; there are several ways to fetch subsets of atoms, or even one
    at a time, when needed.

(define*-public (fetch-query QUERY KEY

"
 fetch-query QUERY KEY [METADATA [FRESH]] [STORAGE]

   Perform the QUERY at the storage server, and load the results into
   the AtomSpace. The results will be returned directly and also cached
   at KEY. The QUERY must be either a JoinLink, MeetLink or QueryLink.

   This can be thought of as a generalization of `load-referers`,
   `fetch-incoming-set` and `fetch-incoming-by-type`. Thus, the
   simplest JoinLink is effectively the same thing as `load-referers`,
   while a JoinLink with a depth of one is the same thing as
   `fetch-incoming-set`, and a JoinLink with a type restriction is the
   same thing as `fetch-incoming-by-type`.

   The storage server is free to return previously cached results for
   the query, instead of running it freshly. The storage server is
   free to refuse to perform the search.

   The METADATA Atom is optional.  If it is specified, then metadata
   about the search results is placed on QUERY at the key METADATA.
   This may include a time-stamp of when the search was performed,
   or an indicator that the search was refused (was not performed.)

   The FRESH boolean value is optional. If set to #t, then it is
   a request to the storage server to re-run the query, instead of
   returning previously cached results. The storage server may not
   honor this request; status is returned in METADATA.

   Not all storage servers are capable of performing all queries.
   If a storage server is unable to perform a query, the status
   is placed at the METADATA key.

   See also:
     `fetch-incoming-set` to fetch the incoing set of an Atom.
     `load-referers` to fetch all graphs containing an Atom.

 cog-delete! ATOM [STORAGE]
    Remove the indicated ATOM, but only if it has no incoming links.
    If it has incoming links, the remove fails.  If storage is attached,
    the ATOM is also removed from the storage.

    Returns #t if the atom was removed, else returns #f if not removed.

    Use cog-extract! to remove from the AtomSpace only, leaving storage
    unaffected.

    Use cog-delete-recursive! to force removal of this atom, together
    with any links that might be holding this atom.
