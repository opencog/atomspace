; Simple debug tracing support.
;
; Handy utilities to write log messages to a file.
; The problem addressed here is that lots of scheme code (e.g. the
; relex2logic rules) run wrapped in C++ code, and some of that C++
; code does not correctly redirect printed output (e.g. the
; foreward & backward chainers). Rather than fixing this I/O
; problem, we have a quick hack here: just dump trace messages to a
; file.  This is simple, easy, and avoids the complexity of the
; opencog logger subsystem.
