Scheme (guile) modules
----------------------

This directory contains various scheme (guile) modules for working
with opencog. This includes the base system, as well as extensions
of various sorts. Soome of the major ones include the pattern matcher
(in the `opencog query` module), the rule engine, the SQL interfaces,
etc.

In addition, there are some examples:

-- example-dbi.scm: How to use the dbi interface to access SQL tables.


==WIRES
The "wires" directory contains a currently abandoned, but interesting
implementation of a "constraint propagation system", wherein OpenCog 
hypergraphs are treated like electrical circuits, with interactions
flowing between them. The idea may be worth resurrecting, although
currently there's no strong motivation.
