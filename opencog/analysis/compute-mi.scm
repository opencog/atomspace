; OVERVIEW
; --------
; The scripts below compute the mutual information held in pairs
; of "items".  The "items" can be any atoms, arranged in ordered pairs,
; usually by a ListLink. For example,
;
;     ListLink
;          SomeAtom "left-side"
;          OtherKinfOfAtom "right-hand-part"
;
; It is presumed that the atomspace already contains such pairs, with
; counts attached to each. The prototypical example is a word-pair,
; connected with an "ANY" link-grammar link:
;
;   EvaluationLink
;      LinkGrammarRelationshipNode "ANY"
;      ListLink
;         WordNode "some-word"
;         WordNode "other-word"
;
; In the general case, access to this structure is provided by methods
; on the "low-level API". These include:
;   'left-type and 'right-type, both of which should return 'WordNode
;         for the above.
;   'item-pair, which should return the EvaluationLink, given the
;        ListLink
;   'left-wildcard and 'right-wildcard, indicating where the partial
;        sums, such as N(x,*) and N(*,y) should be stored.

; Let N(wl,wr) denote the number of times that the pair (wl, wr) has
; actually been observed; that is, N("some-word", "other-word") for the
; example above.  Properly speaking, this count is conditioned on the
; LinkGrammarRelationshipNode "ANY", so the correct notation would be
; N(rel, wl, wr) with `rel` the relationship.  In what follows, the
; relationship is always assumed to be the same, and is thus dropped.
; (the relationship is provided through the GET-PAIR functiion).
;
; The mutual information for a pair is defined as follows:  Given
; two items, wl and wr, define three probabilities:
;
;    P(wl,wr) = N(wl,wr) / N(*,*)
;    P(wl,*)  = N(wl,*)  / N(*,*)
;    P(*,wr)  = N(*,wr)  / N(*,*)
;
; The N(*,*), N(wl,*) and  N(*,wr) are wild-card counts, and are defined
; to be sums over all observed left and right counts.  That is,
;
;    N(wl,*) = Sum_wr N(wl,wr)
;    N(*,wr) = Sum_wl N(wl,wr)
;    N(*,*) = Sum_wl Sum_wr N(wl,wr)
;
; These sums are computed, for a given item, by the `make-compute-count`
; object defined below.  It attached these counts at the locations
; provided by the underlying object. By default, thse are given by
; `add-pair-count-api` object, althought these are designed to be
; overloaded, if needed.

; For example, for word-pair counts, the wild-card sums are stored
; with the atoms
;
;   EvaluationLink
;      LinkGrammarRelationshipNode "ANY"
;      ListLink
;         AnyNode "left-word"
;         WordNode "bird"
;
;   EvaluationLink
;      LinkGrammarRelationshipNode "ANY"
;      ListLink
;         WordNode "word"
;         AnyNode "right-word"
;
;   EvaluationLink
;      LinkGrammarRelationshipNode "ANY"
;      ListLink
;         AnyNode "left-word"
;         AnyNode "right-word"
;
; Here, AnyNode plays the role of *.  Thus, N(*,*) is shorthand for the
; last of these triples.
;
; After they've been computed, the values for N(*,y) and N(x,*) can be
; fetched with the 'left-wild-count and 'right-wild-count methods on
; the object.  The value for N(*,*) can be gotten with the
; 'wild-wild-count method.
;
; The fractional mutual information for the pair (x,y) is defined as
;
;     MI(x,y) = - log_2 [ p(x,y) /  p(x,*) p(*,y) ]
;
; This is computed by the script batch-all-pair-mi below. The value is
; attached at the location provided by the 'set-pair-mi method on the
; object.  It can later be retrieved with the corresponding 'pair-mi
; method.
;
; The main utility wrapper not only computes all of these, but also
; stores them in the database, from which they can be retreived at some
; future date.  This helps avoid repeating the calculation, which can
; take many hours for large datasets (tens of millions of pairs).

; Among the things that are computed and stored are the partial sums
