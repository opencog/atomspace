Caution:
The stuff in this directory is broken and bit-rotted.
If you want native postgres drivers, they are in the multi-driver
directory.

There's a neat idea here, about an overflow edge table.
I suppose it could be ported to the multi-driver codebase.

But the rest of the code fails to make use of the latest design
changes for the backend API, for the TLB management, and for the
hashing of atoms.
