/**
 * This class provides a simple, generic interface for communicating
 * Atoms and Values between the local and a remote server (often, a
 * storage or "persistence" server. The general model is that the local
 * AtomSpace is not persistent (it's in RAM, it disappears when the
 * process exits), while the remote server may be persistent (if it is
 * backed to a file or other long-term storage.).
 *
 * This class focuses on "on-demand" atom retrieval, rather than on
 * bulk-save/restore.
 *
 * Most methods return `void`, so that they can run asynchronously.
 * That is, there is no requirement that these methods have completed
 * when they return. The only requirement is that all methods called
 * before a call to `barrier()` must have completed by the time that
 * `barrier()` returns.
