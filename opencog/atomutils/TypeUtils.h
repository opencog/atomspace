 * `left` is broader, less restricitve than `right`; equivalently
 * if `right` is narrower than 'left`.
 *
 * Mating types and values:
 * left == (Type "Concept")    right == (Concept "foo")  can mate.
 * left == (Type "Concept")    right == (Number 13)  cannot.
 *
 * Mating types and types:
 * left == (Type "Concept")    right == (Type "Concept")  can mate.
 *
 * Left is wider (polymorphic, in this case)
 *   left == (TypeChoice (Type "Concept") (Type "Number"))
 *   right == (Type "Number")  can mate.
 *
 * Function call arguments can be checked:
 *   left == (Arrow (Type "Concept") (Type "Number"))
 *   right == (Concept "foo")  can mate.
 *
 *   left == (Arrow (Type "Concept") (Type "Number"))
 *   right == (Number 13)  cannot.
 *
 * Function call chains can be checked:
 *   left == (Arrow (Type "Concept") (Type "Number"))
 *   right == (Type "Concept")  can mate.
 *
 * The following can mate, because left accepts a concept as input,
 * and right generates a concept as output:
 *   left == (Arrow (Type "Concept") (Type "Number"))
 *   right == (Arrow (Type "Evaluation") (Type "Concept")
 *
 * Any type specification is valid: SignatureLinks, etc work too.
