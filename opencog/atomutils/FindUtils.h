/// There are two different types of utilities in this file: those that
/// tell you if some target atom or target atom type occurs in some
/// tree, returning a simple yes/no answer, and another utility, telling
/// you exactly where it occurs.  We start with the more complicated one
/// first.  Otherwise, skip down to get at the simpler ones.

//================================================================
/// The FindAtoms class is used to locate atoms of a given type or
/// target that occur inside some clause.  The target is specified in
/// the constructor, the clause to be searched is given with the
/// 'search_set()' method. After the search has been done, the targets
/// are available in the various public members.
///
/// Find a "target atom", or find all atoms of a given "target type",
/// and all of the links that hold that target, that occur in a clause
/// (an expression tree formed by the outgoing set.) This is typically
/// used to find all variables in an expression, but it can be used for
/// any purpose.
///
/// After search_set() is called, the set of target atoms that were found
/// can be retreived from the public member `varset`.  The set of links
/// that had one of these targets occuring somewhere, anywhere, within
/// them is in the public member `holders`. This includes the holders of
/// holders, etc, all the way up to the very top.  The `least_holders`
/// member will contain only those links that contain a target in their
/// immediate outgoing set.  That is, the `least_holders` are the
/// smallest links that contain the target.
///
/// A "target" is defined in one of two ways: It is either a specified
/// target type, or it is any one of the given set of specific target
/// atoms.  When only the type is given, it will typically be
/// VARIABLE_NODE, GROUNDED_PREDICATE_NODE or GROUNDED_SCHEMA_NODE,
/// COMPOSE_LINK, or something like that, and so this just finds these
/// atom types if they occur in the clause(s).  Alternately, if a set
/// of specific atoms is given, then this finds the subset of that set
/// that actually occurs in the given clause(s).  That is, it computes
/// the intersection between the set of given atoms, and the set of all
/// atoms that occur in the clauses.
///
/// Note that anything quoted (by the use of
/// QUOTE_LINK/LOCAL_QUOTE_LINK/UNQUOTE_LINK) is not explored.  Thus,
/// a quote acts like a cut, halting recursion until it gets unquoted
/// later on with an UNQUOTE_LINK.
