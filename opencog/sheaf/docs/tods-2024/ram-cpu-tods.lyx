\begin_layout Abstract
This text reviews the concepts of a graph store, starting from the fundamental
 question of how to efficiently represent a graph in RAM (that is, in storage).
 Starting with a naive conception of a graph database, it arrives at hypergraphs
 and metagraphs as minor modifications to the storage format of a graph.
 The resulting structure proves to be simpler and more efficient for representin
g graph data.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Abstract
This starts a domino chain of claims: Metagraphs are more flexible than
 either graph stores or SQL-style table stores or JSON-stores for storing
 data.
 Metagraphs have a natural query language that is more powerful and easier
 to use than SQL-inspired query languages, mostly because the table-join
 concept is obviated and replaced by isomorphism.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Abstract
It is easy to specify a term rewriting system with metagraphs; it is a trite
 extension of having a query system.
 Both forward and reverse queries are natural, and so metagraphs provide
 a solid foundation for rule-based systems.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Abstract
Metagraphs are naturally typed, in the sense of type theory.
 Metagraphs are easily reified, and so the type system is itself trivially
 expressible as metagraphs.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Abstract
Metagraphs can be used to specify a programming system/programming language,
 but that language is low-level, and not really suitable for humans.
 It is ideal for algorithmic (machine) manipulation, analogous to intermediate
 languages inside of compilers.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Abstract
Most of these claims are founded on experimental results, rather than assertions
 of theoretical analysis.
 The experimental platform is the OpenCog AtomSpace and Atomese language.

\begin_layout Title
Graphs, Metagraphs, RAM, CPU
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Introduction
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Currently, graph databases are popular, as they have a rather distinct performan
ce profile, differing from both SQL and noSQL databases.
 At a simplistic level, the OpenCog AtomSpace is a kind of a graph database.
 More correctly, it is a generalized-hypergraph or 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

metagraph
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 database.
 This design has certain implications for RAM and CPU usage.
 This text argues that it has superior properties to ordinary graph databases.
 It arrives at this conclusion by starting with the most basic, foundational
 description of graph databases, and then defines hypergraphs and metagraphs
 as minor variants on the underlying data structures.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Graphs offer an interesting storage format for many reasons.
 Coupled to those reasons is a need for graph traversal, and another need
 for graph query (solving the subgraph isomorphism problem).
 Thus, the questions examined here include how one might best be able to
 traverse graphs, and how to best perform subgraph matching.
 By 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

best
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, it is meant algorithms that find a good balance between speed and size.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This text is organized into the following sections:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
A naive definition of graphs.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
An aside about attaching attributes to the edges and vertexes of a graph.
 This is effectively a quick summary of traditional knowledge representation
 formats, specifically, tables, JSON and s-expressions.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
How graphs can be represented in memory (RAM), and how much storage is used
 to represent a graph.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Modifications to the representation that result in hypergraphs and metagraphs,
 including an analysis of memory usage.
 A formal definition of a metatree, the core component of a metagraph.
 A key result is that metatrees are more compact than graphs for most data
 representation problems.
 The first hints that they are also more natural and easier to work with
 start to show.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
A discussion of the concept of 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

indexing
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, and how indexes are used to find data.
 Contrasts are drawn between indexing in graphs, and indexing in SQL databases.
 (The noSQL databases are given short shrift, mostly because of a famous
 result showing that they are actually an 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

opposite category
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, best termed coSQL.
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Meijer2011"
literal "false"

\end_inset

) A key observation is that metagraphs unavoidably have a certain kind of
 index built into them; they come equipped with a (partial) index.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
A discussion of partial indexes, and their role in database normalization.
 An argument is made that metatrees are self-normalizing.
 This feels perhaps uncomfortable, given the vast resources that database
 textbooks expend on teaching normalization to students.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Representing metatrees as strings, with specific attention focused on the
 fact that subtrees are necessarily unique, and how this uniqueness can
 be managed in a practical way.
 This includes a rejection of UUID's as a technique for assigning unique
 labels to metatrees.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
A discussion of insertion, deletion and graph mutability.
 A primary result is that metatrees are necessarily immutable, as otherwise
 a host of useful and desirable assumptions are shattered.
 This is a positive result: immutability is a marvelous property for data
 structures to have, when they are being accessed by multi-threaded systems.
 A secondary result is that a metagraph database looks exactly like a single
 metatree, but a mutable one.
 Thus, there are two kinds of metatrees: the immutable ones are called 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

data
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 and the mutable ones are called 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

databases
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
 Since they are both metatrees, they can be layered, nested, stacked, as
 desired.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
A review of query languages and graph traversal.
 A primary result is that all SQL-inspired query languages inherit the table-bas
ed viewpoint of SQL.
 This in turn causes one to think in terms of table joins, which, in a graph
 setting, looks like an explicitly-specified graph walk, chaining from one
 edge to the next.
 This is seen in systems such as GraphQL, SparQL, Neo4J or grakn.ai (TypeDB),
 which present graph queries in terms of explicit edge walks.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
An example of a metagraph query language, which hops outside of the *QL
 paradigm of edge walks (
\emph on
aka
\emph default
 table joins), into a query mode that more closely resembles pattern matching.
 Unlike conventional pattern matching, graph query must be recursive, and
 thus cannot be implemented as a state machine.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
A short discussion of query analysis and query planning for a metagraph
 query language.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
A presentation of inverted queries.
 These are queries that are 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

answers
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 in search of a 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

question
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
 They consist entirely of constant terms, to be matched to forward-queries
 having variables in them.
 Inverted queries are the bread-and-butter of chat-bots and rule engines.
 Metatrees represent inverted queries just as readily and naturally as forward
 queries; this is because a partial index on a metatree can be understood
 as a kind of trie.
 Metatrees unify database concepts with rule engine concepts within the
 same framework.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
A discussion of the natural interpretation of metatrees.
 The experimental result here, after a decade of use, is that metatrees
 correspond to type-theoretical types.
 They reify easily and naturally, and have an obvious suite of type constructors.
 As you might guess from the tone of voice here, the type constructors are
 themselves just metatrees.
 The concept of sheaves is touched upon very quickly here, as the sheaf
 elements are just 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

jigsaw puzzle pieces
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 and the jigsaw connectors are types.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
A discussion of execution, evaluation, fexprs, macros, $vau, term rewriting
 systems and intermediate languages.
 Obviously, abstract syntax trees are a special case of trees, and trees
 are a special case of metatrees.
 Abstract syntax trees achieve two things: they encode executable programs,
 and they also encode syntactic structure that can be re-written by homotopic
 transformations.
 As such, they bridge across some old ideas in lisp (fexprs, $vau) and newer
 ideas in knowledge representation (prolog).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
A discussion of human-oriented programming languages vs.
 machine-oriented programming languages.
 Metatrees and metagraphs are themselves too low a level to be suitable
 as a programming language which human beings would want to use on a daily
 basis.
 Instead, they have more in common with compiler intermediate languages,
 which are term rewriting systems used by machines (compilers) to perform
 transformations on data.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As a conclusion, it is noted that the OpenCog AtomSpace has been the experimenta
l platform on which all of the above results have been obtained, and embodies
 most of the ideas presented here.

Graph Representations
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Formally, a graph is

\begin_layout Itemize
A set of vertexes 
\begin_inset Formula $V=\left\{ v_{1},v_{2},\cdots,v_{M}\right\} $
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
A set of edges 
\begin_inset Formula $E=\left\{ e_{1},e_{2},\cdots,e_{N}\right\} $
\end_inset

 where each edge 
\begin_inset Formula $e_{k}$
\end_inset

 is an ordered pair of vertexes drawn from the set 
\begin_inset Formula $V$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Because edges are ordered pairs, it is conventional to denote them with
 arrows, having a head and tail.
 These can be joined together in arbitrary ways.
 Below is a

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Attributes
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In practice, one wishes to associate a label to each vertex, and also some
 additional attribute data; likewise for the edges.
 There are three fundamental choices available for storing attributes: merged
 schema+data, disjoint schema–data and s-expressions.
 An examples of the first is JSON.
 Each block of data to be stored is preceded by its name.
 Additional markup, such as quotes and square brackets, indicate structure
 such as text-strings and arrays.
 An example of disjoint schema–data are tables.
 The name and data type appears only in the column heading for the table;
 individual rows in the table do not need to repeat the schema.
 Clearly, for tables with more than a few rows, the tabular format offers
 a huge advantage in terms of memory usage.
 Conversely, having many tables with just one or two rows each quickly becomes
 a table management problem; conventional systems are not designed to hold
 a million tables of one row each.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Tables are highly inflexible when new columns or new schema need to be added.
 There is no sensible way to take one row of a table, and have it use a
 different schema than the other rows.
 It doesn't even make sense to talk about rows in this way; if one row has
 a different schema than another, they aren't rows of the same table any
 more.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
An example of an s-expression store is a key-value store.
 Here, the first word is taken to be the key; subsequent words are taken
 to be a list of values associated with that key.
 The idea of s-expressions emphasizes that the key-value store can be hierarchic
ally structured.
 An example is the Unix file-system structure: each directory can have files,
 but it can also have subdirectories, 
\emph on
ad infinitum
\emph default
.
 In this sense, a URL can be understood to be a kind-of s-expression.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In a graph store, one has these three basic choices for storing attributes,
 both for vertexes and for edges.
 One might even contemplate a mixture; after all, a JSON blob is isomorphic
 to a table with only a single row.
 The remainder of this text will make little or no assumptions about the
 storage format of the attributes, as this has little or no impact on the
 primary topics here.
 With one exception: query and indexing.
 This is reviewed in a distinct section later on.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Emulating Tables
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This section aims to make the above commentary a bit more concrete by working
 though some examples.
 Although the examples in this section are written in text, the reader is
 very strongly urged to try to imagine how these structures might be represented
 in RAM, and how much storage they might take.
 A later section will return to these questions of in-RAM representations.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Consider the need to store data about some students.
 Expressed in JSON format, it might be written as:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset listings
lstparams "basicstyle={\footnotesize\sffamily},tabsize=3"
inline false
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout

	{ grades: [	{ student: {name: Joe},    {gpa: 3.5}},
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

					{ student: {name: Mary},   {gpa: 3.6}},
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

					{ student: {name: Rachel}, {gpa: 3.0}} ]}
\end_layout

\end_inset

The square brackets denote a list; as is conventional with a list, all list
 elements are uniform and of the same type.
 Clearly, this appears to be a very regular structure.
 If there are hundreds of students, one might try to save some space by
 eliminating the repeated attribute names.
 If JSON is used for this, this becomes a column-store:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset listings
lstparams "basicstyle={\footnotesize\sffamily},tabsize=3"
inline false
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout

		{ table:	{ schema: {name: string}, {gpa: float}}
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

					{ names:  [Joe, Mary, Rachel ] },
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

					{ gpa:    [3.5, 3.6, 3.0 ] }}
\end_layout

\end_inset

That is, each entry in the table is a column name, followed by a list of
 all of the values in that column.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This is distinct from a row-store.
 In a row store, one conventionally provides a schema describing the columns
 and their formats, much as above, and then provides the rows, one by one,
 as 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

records
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, or inhomogeneous lists of fixed length.
 That is, each entry in the list has a different type (it has the type of
 the column), but each list is exactly the same length; thus, a 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

record
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

There does not appear to be any way of representing a row-store in JSON,
 at least not in the JSON as naively conceived here.
 One wishes to write something like the below, but the syntax makes it illegal:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset listings
lstparams "basicstyle={\footnotesize\sffamily},tabsize=3"
inline false
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout

	{ table:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

		{ schema: {name: string}, {gpa: float}}
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

		{ students: [	(Joe,    3.5),		# This is not valid JSON!
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

						(Mary,   3.6),
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

						(Rachel, 3.0) ]}}
\end_layout

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It is this last example that makes clear that an s-expression store can
 offer the best of both worlds.
 This is shown in the next section.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
OGRE: Open Generic Representation
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A particularly nice and human-friendly API can be found in the OGRE module
 in BAP.
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "OGRE"
literal "false"

\end_inset

 It is an s-expression database that allows new data structures to be defined
 in generic ways.
 In short, any s-expression is a valid record.
 Records do not need to be of the same length, or of the same type.
 Thus, the previous example can be written as
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset listings
lstparams "basicstyle={\footnotesize\sffamily},tabsize=3"
inline false
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout

		(student (name Joe)    (gpa 3.5))
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

		(student (name Mary)   (gpa 3.6))
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

		(student (name Rachel) (gpa 3.0))
\end_layout

\end_inset

Note that these are three distinct records, and are NOT a list of three
 rows! As written, this has a distinctly JSONic feel to it, in that every
 value is tagged with the field type that names it.
 But then, the OGRE documentation notes that this is equivalent to 
\end_layout

provided that one already knows the column structure of the data.
 But this is easily achieved:

\begin_layout Plain Layout

This last statement resembles a conventional table-database table declaration.
 One can go farther: there is no particular need to tag each row with the
 row-label 
\family sans
\size small
'student'
\family default
\size default
.
 The most compact representation then appears to be the following: 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset listings
lstparams "basicstyle={\footnotesize\sffamily},tabsize=3"
inline false

\begin_layout Plain Layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

								(Rachel 3.0))
\end_layout

\end_inset

This last form now obviously has the shape of a row-store.
 Each row is a tuple, all tuples look alike.
 This last form enables a rather conventional SQL query system to be defined.
 There is a table definition, providing column types, and column labels
 (the labels are needed for query/search), and the individual records (rows)
 in the table are uniform.
 The uniformity allows both for very compact storage and easy query.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The nature of query in these three styles, and what it implies for RAM consumpti
on and CPU use, is quite dramatic.
 They can have remarkably different performance profiles, and even some
 remarkable limitations in the kinds of queries that can be imagined or
 can be written.
 This is a more complex topic, and will be returned to later in this text.

 Much of this text presumes these theoretical foundations are percolating

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
An SQL Table declaration corresponding to the above example is
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset listings
lstparams "basicstyle={\footnotesize\sffamily},tabsize=3"

\begin_layout Plain Layout

		CREATE TABLE student (

\begin_layout Plain Layout

\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

			gpa real

\begin_layout Plain Layout

		)
\end_layout

\end_inset

The interpretation is meant to be straight-forward: a table with two columns,
 one of which is an unlimited length character string, the other a single-precis
ion floating point number.
 We could do the same in C++ (or Java, or any conventional object oriented
 language) and write 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset listings
lstparams "basicstyle={\footnotesize\sffamily},tabsize=3"

\begin_layout Plain Layout

		};

In terms of knowledge representation, these all express the same idea.
 The practical differences between these are whether the structures are
 created at runtime (as they would be for SQL, or scheme/lisp) or compile

 The Cartesian product of two sets 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $B$
\end_inset

, in set-builder notation, is 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
A\times B=\left\{ \left(a,b\right)\vert a\in A\mbox{ and }b\in B\right\} 
\]

\end_inset

We want 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

 to be the set of students and 
\begin_inset Formula $B$
\end_inset

 to be the set of grades they could get; these are not only different sets,
 but the types of the members of these sets are different.
 This leads to the product type 
\begin_inset Formula ${\bf A}\times{\bf B}$
\end_inset

 where the 
\begin_inset Formula ${\bf A}$
\end_inset

 is the type of text strings, and 
\begin_inset Formula ${\bf B}$
\end_inset

 is the type of numbers with decimal places.
 Members are again written as 
\begin_inset Formula $\left(a,b\right)$
\end_inset

 or perhaps 
\begin_inset Formula $\left(a:{\bf A},b:{\bf B}\right)$
\end_inset

 Naming-wise, the prefix

 In the text that follows, there will be lots of arrows, pointing both forwards,
 and backwards.
 These can all be understood in terms of the type-theoretic foundations
 sketched here.
 A more formal presentation of the type theory requires the development
 of sheaf theory in the context of knowledge representation, and is outside
 the current scope of this text.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Not all of the arrows that will be drawn in the subsequent text can be understoo
d as category-theoretic arrows.
 Category theory has some fairly strict ideas about what one can do with
 arrows, and thus, not every diagram will be a valid category.
 However, many of them will be.
 The most important examples of arrows that can be interpreted as category-theor
etic arrows are the indexes on SQL tables (

 and

Graphs for Storing Data

The above listed three ways of storing attributes on a graph, and yet ignored
 the graph itself.
 Thus, for completeness, lets draw the diagram of how this might be stored
 in a graph.

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In the above, the vertexes are labeled with s-expressions; the edges are
 not labeled.
 It consists of two disjoint graphs; one of the graphs is used to encode
 the type information used in the other graph.
 There are a large variety of choices that can be made in how this is done.
 The above just shows one way; it might not be the best way, although that
 depends on the problem domain.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Below shows another alternative, this time with labeled edges:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\align center
\begin_inset Graphics
	filename ../graphics/joe-mary-v2-wide.eps
	width 42col%

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As before, the graph explicitly includes a description of the schema used
 in another part of the graph.
 For the first time, a non-trivial graph is drawn.
 It begins to give a hint of the utility of graphs for general knowledge
 representation.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Mixed Representations
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In both of the above examples, the graph store was assumed to have some
 distinct, separate attribute store for each vertex, and possibly each edge.
 Thus, in a sense, this is not a 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

pure
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 graph store, where each edge or vertex can only have an atomic singleton
 value on it (a single number or a single string).
 Of course, one could rework the above graphs so that each vertex/edge does
 have just one single value on it.
 While the simplicity of singleton-valued graphs is perhaps intellectually
 appealing, it proves to not be practical for everyday use.
 Assuming singleton-valued graphs also has some very strong implications
 on RAM and CPU use, and the ability to perform searches/queries.
 This point will be returned to below.
 In the meanwhile, this kind of mixed model will be assumed: some data will
 be stored graphically, and some data will be stored as complex attribute
 sets attached to the edges and vertexes.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Some historical hand-waving can be done to justify the origins of a mixed-model
 graph store.
 In predicate logic, and in model theory, one distinguishes the predicates
 and terms that one is discussing, from the truth values or valuations that
 can be assigned to them.
 It is relatively straightforward to envision predicates and terms as trees
 or DAG's.
 The truth values are distinct from the graphs themselves; instead, they
 are an assignment of true/false to each expression.
\begin_inset Foot
status collapsed

\begin_layout Plain Layout
This is the grand leap from Aristotelian, 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

classical
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 logic, to predicate logic.
 The disentanglement of truth-valuations from propositions enables giant
 leaps in reasoning abilities.
 This in turn opens the ability to further disentangle syntactic from semantic
 entailment, thus allowing a connection to grammar and language to be made.
 The adjointness between grammar and graphs is precisely the core, central
 reason why properly constructed graph databases are central to the pursuit
 of AGI.
\end_layout

\end_inset

 A straight-forward example can be found in Prolog: in the beginning, there
 are expressions; by means of inference, truth-value labels are inferred.
 The truth values are not a part of the original graph; they live outside
 of it, as an attribute.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Of course, things get interesting as soon as one leaves the domain of crisp-logi
c T/F values, and considers instead valuations that are Bayesian probabilities.
 Some monkeying around then leads one to distinguish Bayesian probabilities
 from fuzzy logic valuations.
 Other kinds of data worms its way in: confidence intervals; frequentist
 counts; marginals.
 Some of this data is non-numeric, but are choices (
\emph on
e.g.

\emph default
 true, false or unknown) or explicitly symbolic (
\emph on
e.g.

\emph default
 red, blue or green).
 It usually does not take long to realize the practical need for a mixed-model
 graph database, supporting both good graph features, and also supporting
 complex attribute systems attached to each edge/vertex.

 It is usually not too hard to take an in-RAM database, and layer it on
 top of one of these systems to obtain a disk-backed database.
 Of course, there are numerous ifs-and-buts, which provide motivations to
 roll-your-own; these will be ignored in this text.
\begin_inset Foot
status collapsed

\begin_layout Plain Layout
One must resist one wide-spread and common temptation: layering an in-RAM
 database on top of another database that is RAM-hungry.
 This is at best counter-productive: for every byte consumed in one, one
 risks a byte consumed in the other.
 As a result, one can only store half as much data, or must purchase twice
 as much RAM.
 Despite the self-evidence of these last statements, such a layering is
 widely recommended, on the basis of the supposed superiority of the lower
 layer.
 One must be particularly cautious if the lower layer requires the use of
 network communications.
 Networking requires the kernel to become involved, tasking-switching and
 performing IPC.
 This can easily become a performance bottleneck.

 Since it is a set, one can use either a hash-table, a b-tree, or even an

 For the discussion here, the precise format is not directly relevant, and
 so a tabular format will be used to illustrate the ideas.
 Again, the table rows might actually reside in hash-tables or b-trees,

\begin_layout Standard
The goal of having a vertex id (which is necessarily a 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

universally unique id
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 or uuid) is that it is required by the edge table.
 This representation is perhaps too naive.
 To perform a graph traversal, i.e.
 to walk from vertex to vertex, following only connecting edges, one needs
 to know which edges come in, and which edges go out.
 Of course, these can be found in the edge table, but searching the edge
 table is absurd: for an edge table of 
\begin_inset Formula $N$
\end_inset

 edges, such a search takes 
\begin_inset Formula $O\left(N\right)$
\end_inset

 time.
 Thus, it is natural to incorporate a special index for edges into the vertex
 table:

\begin_layout Standard
Note that the incoming and outgoing columns hold sets: any given vertex
 may appear in more than one edge.
 They are sets, not lists, as the order is not particularly important.
 They are not 'multisets': any given edge appears at most once in the incoming/o
utgoing sets.
 Suitable representations for sets include hash-tables and trees, each with
 its own distinct RAM and access-time profile.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Table updates must be both thread safe and fast.
 It is easy to lock the table with a mutex, but this can quickly limit the
 amount of concurrency.
 The latest lock-free technology promises reasonable solutions; however,
 the technology remains immature.
 There are several implementations of concurrent hash maps, but none for
 concurrent multimaps (that also support erase).
 Likewise, lock-free tree implementations are absent; trees offer a considerably
 more compact storage format when tables are small.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Prelude to indexing
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A conventional requirement for graph databases is to locate all nodes and
 vertexes having some particular attribute.
 This opens a Pandora's box of indexing schemes.
 The opening of this box is deferred to a later section, but we can take
 a quick peak: suppose one wants to find all vertexes where the attr-data
 has a field called 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

favorite song
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
 Vertexes representing buildings and automobiles won't have a 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

favorite song
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, vertexes representing people might, but not necessarily.
 Thus, there is a need for an index: a set of all vertexes that have this
 tag.
 Every time a vertex is added or removed, this index might have to be updated.
 Thus, adding indexes in this way incurs a CPU overhead.
 If there are 
\begin_inset Formula $J$
\end_inset

 indexes, then there is an 
\begin_inset Formula $O\left(J\right)$
\end_inset

 CPU overhead for vertex insertion/removal.
 There is also RAM consumption: an index containing 
\begin_inset Formula $K$
\end_inset

 items requires at least 
\begin_inset Formula $O\left(K\right)$
\end_inset

 storage, and possibly 
\begin_inset Formula $O\left(K\log K\right)$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Hypergraphs
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A hypergraph is much like a graph, except that the edges, now called 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

hyperedges
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, can contain more than two vertexes.
 That is, the hyperedge, rather than being an ordered pair of vertexes,
 is an ordered list of vertexes.
 The metagraph takes the hypergraph concept one step further: the hyperedge
 may also contain other hyperedges.
 A change of terminology is useful: the basic objects are now called 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

nodes
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

links
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 instead of 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

vertexes
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

edges
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Formally, a hypergraph is:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
A set of vertexes 
\begin_inset Formula $V=\left\{ v_{1},v_{2},\cdots,v_{M}\right\} $
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
A set of hyperedges 
\begin_inset Formula $E=\left\{ e_{1},e_{2},\cdots,e_{N}\right\} $
\end_inset

 where each hyperedge 
\begin_inset Formula $e_{k}$
\end_inset

 is an ordered list of vertexes drawn from the set 
\begin_inset Formula $V$
\end_inset

.
 This list may be empty, or have one, or two, or more members.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A metagraph is very nearly the same:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
A set of nodes 
\begin_inset Formula $V=\left\{ v_{1},v_{2},\cdots,v_{M}\right\} $
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
A set of links 
\begin_inset Formula $E=\left\{ e_{1},e_{2},\cdots,e_{N}\right\} $
\end_inset

 where each hyperedge 
\begin_inset Formula $e_{k}$
\end_inset

 is an ordered list of nodes, or other links, or a mixture.
 They are arranged to be acyclic (to form a directed acyclic graph).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It is convenient to give the name 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

atoms
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 to something that is either a node or a link.
 Links are thus lists of atoms.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Hypergraph representations
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The naive representation for the hypergraph is a straight-forward extension
 of the edge table (the table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand vpageref
reference "graph edge table"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

 above).
 The table below provides an example that is shown in the figure following
 below.

The vertex list may be empty, may hold one, or more vertexes.
 It is necessarily ordered (and thus not a set) and may contain repeated
 entries (a vertex may appear more than once in the list).
 In other respects, this edge table is quite similar to the edge table for
 ordinary graphs.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As before, the ability to traverse the hypergraph (quickly) is a core requiremen
t.
 This means that, given a vertex, one must be able to quickly find the edges
 attached to it.
 This requires modification to the vertex table given before.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Several choices are possible.
 One is to add a new column for each positional location in the vertex list.
 That is, 0'th column holds the edges which have the corresponding vertex
 in the 0'th position of the vertex list, the 1'th column likewise.
 This can be read off from the table above:

To actually store this table, one must have a data-structure that is a list-of-s
ets, which can be a bit over-complex and challenging to use.
 It is easier to just mash all of these into one set; that is all that is
 needed for hypergraph traversal.
 If the positional location is needed, then it can always be looked up per-hyper
edge.
 This is neither technically challenging nor CPU-intensive: the arity of
 hyperedges is typically small, based on real-world mappings with interesting
 datasets.

Note that the vertex table looks a lot like the edge table, the only difference
 being that the vertex-list in the edge table is an ordered list, while
 the incoming-set (the edge-set) really is a set.
 Effectively, this is because a hypergraph is 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

almost
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 a bipartite graph, having the form below, with the set 
\begin_inset Formula $E$

 on the left being the set of hyperedges.

The boxes denote the fact that the hyperedges are ordered lists.
 The 
\begin_inset Formula $E$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $V$
\end_inset

 ellipses are the hyperedge and vertex tables.
 If the boxes could be collapsed to single points, this would be a 'true'
 bipartite graph; but they cannot be.
 The ordering is needed and important.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
RAM Utilization
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
One might wish to conclude: 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Oh, but a bipartite graph is just a graph, so a graph database is sufficient
 for all my needs.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 At some abstract level, this is perhaps true; at the CPU and RAM-consumption
 level, it is not.
 So, in this figure, attributes (the attr-data) are attached only to the
 
\begin_inset Formula $v_{k}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $e_{k}$
\end_inset

 in the diagram; there is no attribute data attached to the lines in this
 figure.
 What's more, the lines in this figure are not directly recorded in any
 tables; they are implicit only in the structure of the vertex and hyperedge
 tables.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Counting the memory usage is instructive.
 Lets assume that the size of the vertex-id and the edge-id are the same
 – they are pointers or 64-bit ints – so each id requires 1 unit of RAM.
 Assume that lists are either null-terminated or record a length, so that
 a list of 
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset

 items requires 
\begin_inset Formula $n+1$
\end_inset

 units of storage.
 Lets encode sets as lists, to make counting easy; let 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\langle J\right\rangle $
\end_inset

 be the average size of the attribute collection.
 The hyperedges shown in the example figure then require 2+3+3+4=12 units
 of storage, plus 5 more for the hyperedge table itself, and 
\begin_inset Formula $4\left\langle J\right\rangle $
\end_inset

 of attribute storage.
 The vertexes require 4+3+3+2 units of storage, plus 5 for the vertex-table
 itself, plus 
\begin_inset Formula $4\left\langle J\right\rangle $
\end_inset

 more of attributes.
 Summing this, one obtains 
\begin_inset Formula $34+8\left\langle J\right\rangle $
\end_inset

 total RAM consumption.
\end_layout

For the general case, one has
\begin_inset Formula $N_{V}\left(1+\left\langle J\right\rangle +\left\langle N_{I}\right\rangle \right)+N_{E}\left(1+\left\langle J\right\rangle +\left\langle N_{O}\right\rangle \right)$

\begin_layout Standard
The average count of the incoming set is equal to the average count of the
 vertex list, so we can approximate 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\langle N_{I}\right\rangle =\left\langle N_{O}\right\rangle $
\end_inset

; the only reason to track these separately is that one may use hash tables
 or trees for sets, whereas lists require arrays.
 This makes the RAM usage slightly different for the two.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The equivalent representation as a graph requires 
\begin_inset Formula $\left(N_{V}+N_{E}\right)\left(1+\left\langle J\right\rangle \right)+N_{V}\left\langle N_{I}\right\rangle +N_{E}\left\langle N_{O}\right\rangle $
\end_inset

 for the vertex table, and 
\begin_inset Formula $N_{V}\left\langle N_{I}\right\rangle \left(3+\left\langle J_{nil}\right\rangle \right)$
\end_inset

 for the edge table.
 Comparing the this to the expression for the hypertable, we see that the
 vertex table is the same size as the entire hypertable.
 The ordinary graph representation also requires the overhead of the edge
 table; here the 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\langle J_{nil}\right\rangle $
\end_inset

 is the cost of storing an empty attribute list, and the factor of 3 comes
 from storing an ordinary edge-id and it's two endpoints.
 Graph databases can store hypergraphs, but incur a RAM penalty for doing
 so.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Storing hypergraphs in graphs, and vice-versa
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If the only thing that one is storing are hypergraphs, then having a custom
 hypergraph representation really is smaller than the equivalent bipartite
 graph: it dispenses with the need for an explicit ordinary-edge table.
 Does this mean that there's some magic, here? No, not really.
 Every ordinary graph is a special case of a hypergraph, where the hyper-edge
 always has arity two.
 To use an ordinary graph-store to record a single edge, we need 
\begin_inset Formula $3+\left\langle J\right\rangle $
\end_inset

 units of storage: the edge-label, and the two vertexes in the edge.
 To use a hyperedge store to record a single (ordinary) edge, we need 
\begin_inset Formula $4+\left\langle J\right\rangle $
\end_inset

 units of storage: the edge-label, the list of vertexes, and the list terminator.
 Thus, storing an ordinary graph as a hypergraph requires 
\begin_inset Formula $N_{E}$
\end_inset

 more units of storage.
 This seems tolerable: for a million-edge graph, and 64-bit pointers, this
 requires 8MBytes of additional storage.
 On modern machines, the extra 8MBytes seems not all that large.
 There's a bit of a penalty in moving from graph storage to hypergraph storage,
 but it's not that much.
 Modern cellphones have 8GBytes of RAM...
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Moving in the opposite direction is much worse: the penalty is 
\begin_inset Formula $N_{V}\left\langle N_{I}\right\rangle \left(3+\left\langle J_{nil}\right\rangle \right)$
\end_inset

 which is surprisingly large.
 Assuming that 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\langle J_{nil}\right\rangle =1$
\end_inset

, then a million-vertex graph requires 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\langle N_{I}\right\rangle $
\end_inset

 times 32MBytes of additional storage.
 For uniformly-distributed graphs, one might have 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\langle N_{I}\right\rangle $
\end_inset

 of 3 to 10; for scale-free graphs of this size, 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\langle N_{I}\right\rangle $
\end_inset

 might be around 14; for square-root-Zipfian graphs (such as Wikipedia page
 views, or biological datasets: genome, proteome, reactome datasets) the
 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\langle N_{I}\right\rangle $
\end_inset

 would be around 200,

The average size of the incoming set is 
\begin_inset Formula

\end_inset

where

\end_inset

 is the number of connections to vertex 
\begin_inset Formula $v$

\begin_inset Formula $N_{V}$

 is the total number of vertexes.
 For a Zipfian distribution, this is

\[
\left\langle N_{I}\right\rangle =\frac{1}{N_{V}}\int_{1}^{N_{V}}\frac{N_{V}}{v}dv=\log N_{V}

The metagraph differs from the hypergraph in that now a hyperedge (link)
 may contain either another vertex (node) or another link.
 Visually, this is no longer a bipartite graph, but has the shape of a directed
 acyclic graph (DAG), such as the one shown below.

 The metatree can be converted to a DAG in two different ways.
 One way is to collapse the boxes to single points.
 The other way is to dissolve the boxes entirely, and replace a single arrow
 from point-to-box by many arrows, from point to each of the box elements.
 Neither of these conversions are faithful.
 The first erases the ordering within the box, while the second erases the
 grouping that the box provides.

\begin_layout Standard
Notice how this link-table resembles the vertex-table (
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand vpageref
reference "graph vertex table"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

) of an ordinary graph store.
 It has both 'incoming' and 'outgoing' sets, as before.
 There are two differences: the outgoing set is no longer a set, but a list.
 The other is even stranger: the first column (the column of vertexes) has
 been replaced by a column of links!
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Perhaps we are making the wrong comparison? Oddly, it also resembles the
 edge table (
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand vpageref
reference "graph edge table"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

).
 For ordinary directed graphs, each edge is a vertex pair.
 The vertices of an edge may be termed the 'head vertex' and the 'tail vertex';
 equivalently, the outgoing vertex and the incoming vertex (or 
\emph on
vice-versa
\emph default
, depending on how one envisions the arrows).
 These two endpoints are replaced by the incoming set and the outgoing list.
 Now, the first column remains the same: a column of edges, in both cases.
 The overall four-column form remains the same.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Looking at this table, one might imagine that the naive graph tables, the
 hypergraph tables, and the metagraph tables seem to have much in common.
 This is, however, perhaps a bit deceptive, as performance considerations
 dictate the finer aspects of the design.
 This will be looked at next.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Clearly, the metagraph, having the general shape of a DAG, can be wedged
 into an ordinary graph store.
 Conversely, an ordinary graph is merely a metagraph that never goes more
 than one-level deep, and whose links always have arity-two.
 Either format is adequate for representing the other.
 The metagraph, much like the hypergraph, has no need to explicitly declare
 the arrows in the tree; they are not stored, nor do they have attributes.
 The RAM-usage considerations are much like those for the hypergraph.
 We can conclude that it is quite efficient to store a graph in a metagraph,
 but that storing a metagraph in an ordinary graph database pays a large
 penalty.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Indexing
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The above reviewed the basic structure of hypergraphs.
 Database performance depends strongly on the use of indexes.
 Thus, a practical hypergraph database design must address the use of indexes
 and how they moderate performance.
 This section will review the structure of indexes, or rather, the alternatives
 one has for index representation.
 The whole point of using a graph database, as opposed to a collection of
 tables, or key-value database, or a JSON-database, is that the graph structure
 encodes something important about the problem, something that cannot be
 easily achieved by doing table joins or key-value look-ups.
 Some examples of

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It is worth remarking that the so-called noSQL databases are effectively
 'identical' to SQL databases.
 They are 'identical' in the sense of being categorical opposites: the direction
s of all arrows are reversed.
 This was explicitly articulated in a famous paper by Meijer and Bierman.
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Meijer2011"
literal "false"

\end_inset

 Much of the following uses an SQL-style notation; if the reader is more
 familiar with key-value databases, then simply reverse the directions of
 all arrows to obtain the equivalent discussion.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A few comments are in order regarding the SQL-style query notation.
 It has become dominant.
 One can look at systems as different as SparQL and GraphQL, or even the
 OGRE query language
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

\end_inset

 (
\emph on
op.

\emph default
) and clearly see not just the influence of SQL, but in fact a nearly verbatim
 copy of it.
 There is a reason for this dominance, and it is not (just) history.
 The reason is anchored (once again) in table representations, and the presence
 (or rather, lack thereof) of inbuilt indexes in the tables.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This is a good place to make a heretical claim: SQL or it's variants (GraphQL,
 SparQL, ...) are 
\emph on
NOT
\emph default
 the best choice for a metagraph query language.
 The shackles of *QL thinking are remarkably hard to escape.
 Even the principled, category-theoretic foundations such as the Functorial
 Query Language (FQL)
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Spivak2014"

\end_inset

 fail to evade the problems presented here, primarily because it is still
 table-based at it's heart (FQL is reviewed below, to illustrate several
 problems).
 A better alternative will become clear, once a more careful examination
 is made of the role of indexes in queries.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In a metagraph database, just as in a table-based database, there will be
 certain types of queries that are used a lot, and speeding these up through
 indexing is a key requirement.
 How might this work, in practice? Let's examine some queries, and see how
 they might work.
\end_layout

Single attribute queries
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Suppose one wishes to find all nodes with some specific attribute.
 Naively, this requires walking over all nodes, examining the attached attribute
 structure, extracting a named field from the attributes, and examining
 the value of that field.
 This is a task that SQL databases excel at - for example,

The author would like to apologize for this seemingly non-sexy example.
 It is the stereotypical example from database textbooks, and harks back

 actually was a sexy research topic, and helped power the economic ascent
 of the Western world.
 It's importance should not be under-estimated: Ancient Rome was an agrarian
 civilization built on concepts of hierarchical organization; organizational
 hierarchies will continue to describe reality, including AGI.
 Org-charts are boring but important.

 A graph database is not needed for this task.
 Nonetheless, this is a plausible task, even for a graph database.

 The size of this index is 
\begin_inset Formula $O\left(N\right)$
\end_inset

 where 
\begin_inset Formula $N$
\end_inset

 is the number of employees.
 This is necessarily so: one cannot build an index smaller than the number

How might one accomplish indexing like this in a graph database? The simplest,

 They are 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

 of the department.
 Basically, the vertexes are labeled, thus escaping the overhead of crawling
 through a collection of attributes to find one in particular.
 One also creates an unlabeled, attribute-free edge, from the department
 name back to the full employee record.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This is to be contrasted to a conventional table database.
 The contents of a conventional table (row) database, after indexing, is
 illustrated below.
 Before indexing, the vertexes

\end_inset

 and edges 
\begin_inset Formula $e_{1},e_{2},e_{3},e_{4},e_{5}$

 The act of indexing creates these vertexes and edges.
 The documentation for conventional table databases does not 'talk about'
 vertexes and edges; but,

 When they think about creating an index on a table, this is what they think

This is not meant to be a psychological assessment; rather it is meant to
 provide a translation between the 'algebraic' form of typed commands sent
 to relational DB's, and an equivalent 'geometric', visual form.
 It is the denotational semantics of the index.
 The geometric form can be understood as being either metaphorical and abstract,
 or it can be taken literally, as a collection of pointers and the things
 they point to.

This diagram exposes some unusual possibilities: If one is interested only

 Effectively, this is a partial index, with correspondingly less RAM usage!
 This is not possible in a naive table system; one needs a system which
 explicitly supports partial indexes.
 As it happens, most-all SQL systems do.
 An experienced SQL DBA knows exactly how to achieve this effect:

 This is not a big deal, and so, here, at least, graphs do not offer any

\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Space and Time
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Comparing RAM-usage, at first glance, there is no particular difference
 between the SQL and the graph database.
 Naively, both require 
\begin_inset Formula $O\left(N\right)$
\end_inset

 for 
\begin_inset Formula $N$
\end_inset

 employees, plus 
\begin_inset Formula $O\left(N_{D}\right)$
\end_inset

 for 
\begin_inset Formula $N_{D}$
\end_inset

 different departments.
 Looking more carefully, there are also the edges 
\begin_inset Formula $e_{1},e_{2},e_{3},e_{4},e_{5}$
\end_inset

.
 In the SQL case, these edges were implicit in the index: after all, the
 index was a collection of ordered pairs 
\begin_inset Formula $\left(D,\left\{ R\right\} \right)$
\end_inset

: the edges run from 
\begin_inset Formula $D$
\end_inset

 to 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\{ R\right\} $
\end_inset

.
 In the graph representation, these edges become explicit: that is, they
 appear in an explicit table, with attached attributes, even if the attributes
 are null.
 Shades of hypergraphs! Why, this was exactly the 
\emph on
same
\emph default
 situation as with the hypergraph! Squinting more carefully, the indexed
 employee table is nothing other than a bipartite graph! Thus, one can effective
ly say: the indexes in an SQL database are 
\emph on
de facto
\emph default
 hypergraphs under the covers, even though no one ever explicitly says so.
 The bipartite nature of the graph makes this overt.
 Surprise!
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The explicit hypergraph representation does cost more than its implicit
 form in SQL databases.
 An SQL index can be a b-tree or hash table; the only thing that the b-tree/hash
 table needs to store is the row ID.
 For a hypergraph, we have imposed the additional requirement that hypergraphs
 must be rapidly traversable.
 This forces the storage of the incoming set in addition to the outgoing
 set.
 Hypergraph stores necessarily use more RAM than equivalent SQL tables.
 But recall why we did this: rapid graph traversal.
 Graph traversal in SQL is easy for trivial graphs, but becomes profoundly
 challenging for anything more complex.

 Some more examples of challenging queries will be presented later.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Suppose you are clever enough to write deep table joins in SQL.
 Is your query planner as clever as you? Most SQL systems have a query analyzer
 or query compiler, which takes a given SQL statement, analyzes its structure,
 and then creates a plan as to which data shall be fetched first, and in
 what order.
 Poor planning results in poor performance, sometimes disastrously poor
 performance.
 For large databases, there has been a vast (multi-billion-dollar) investment
 in sophisticated query planning.
 Walking graphs, represented in terms of tables and indexes, is not for
 the faint of heart.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
CPU usage considerations are harder to dissect.
 To avoid discussions of network overhead in client-server architectures,
 its easier, here, to limit discussions to databases that run in the same
 address space as the application.
 Thus, for SQL bench-marking, one might look at SQLite, which runs embedded,
 rather than Postgres, which requires network interfaces.

Partial indexes reveal their utility in another way.
 Sticking with the management example from above, consider extending and

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Conventionally, corporations, political and military organizations are organized
 hierarchically, with divisions reporting to executives, departments rolling
 up into divisions, and so on.
 This is precisely the structure of a metatree.
 It is tempting to gloss this, and say that the org chart is a tree, or
 perhaps a DAG.
 It is not! It is a metatree, and confusion arises because a metatree can
 be collapsed to a DAG in several different ways.
 So, consider a division chief who manages a line item.
 One can draw the org-chart several ways: by drawing an edge from a manager
 to each (named) employee that they manage, or from the manager to a functional
 box labeled with the function.
 Employees are then grouped inside these functional boxes.
 This is shown below.

Normalization
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The implication for RAM usage is similar to that of 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

database normalization
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
 In a naive, un-normalized table format, one might store, for each employee,
 the employee name, the department, the 2nd line, the division and the name
 of the company.
 This is a bit silly in terms of storage: 5 columns are needed; for 
\begin_inset Formula $N$
\end_inset

 employees, this requires 
\begin_inset Formula $O\left(5N\right)$
\end_inset

 storage.
 One 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

normalizes
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 by storing only the employee-department relationship with a table of 
\begin_inset Formula $O\left(2N\right)$
\end_inset

 in size, and the remainder of the org chart in a separate table, also of
 two columns, encoding the directed tree reporting structure.
 This offers a huge space savings.
 For 
\begin_inset Formula $N_{D}$
\end_inset

 departments/divisions, this second table is 
\begin_inset Formula $O\left(2N_{D}\right)$
\end_inset

 and clearly, 
\begin_inset Formula $5N\gg2N+2N_{D}$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Look-ups in a normalized database proceed through table joins.
 To find all employees in a division, one looks up what 2nd lines report
 to the division, what departments report to the second line, and what employees
 report to the departments (this is the 'transitive closure' of a recursive
 relation.) The indexing proceeds just as described before.
 The table joins are an 
\emph on

\emph default
 graph walk.
 The SQL for this is a bit nasty, but still effectively human-readable:
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

 different rows in the org chart table.
 SQL does not offer any basic primitives for joining different rows together;
 this requires a good bit of creativity on the part of the DBA.
\end_layout

\end_inset

 This SQL snippet is oversimplified by quite a bit, but it does convey the
 general spirit of the thing.
 It is attempting to specify a graph-walk without explicitly acknowledging
 that there is a graph hidden under the covers.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The key message here is that metagraphs retain the key benefits of table
 normalization, while making the graphical nature of indexing explicit.
 They do even more: they effectively 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

automate
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 table normalization.
 To some fairly large degree, you no longer have to explicitly think about
 table normalization.
 It 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

just happens naturally
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, as you organize data into graphical form.
 This is not because there is some super-clever algo running under the covers,
 performing magic normalization.
 It is instead purely a byproduct of changing one's perspective about data
 and it's structure.
\end_layout

Comparing metagraphs to graph stores, one sees a different improvement.

\begin_layout Subsection
Index Maintenance
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Indexes are central to defining the relationships between bits of data.
 But such relationships cannot stay fixed: as a database is used, reasons
 are found to add new relationships, and to modify or delete existing relationsh
ips.
 Practical issues arise: changes must be made without corrupting existing
 data or (unintentionally) losing information.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This proves to be a particular challenge to SQL-style databases, and it
 is educational to review the reasons.
 In an SQL system, the relationships between bits of data are defined by
 the initial database architect: the person who first creates the table
 definitions, the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

database schema
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
 Changes to those definitions (additions of new tables, the reorganization
 of columns in existing tables, 
\emph on
etc.
\emph default
) requires a process of 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

data migration
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
 It is conceived in this way, since one is changing not just a table definition,
 but one is also moving all of the rows in that table.
 This is a CPU and RAM-consuming process: for tables with millions of rows,
 or more, this may take hours or days.
 When migrating datasets, it is very important to not accidentally corrupt
 the structures containing the data through poor data migration design (
\emph on
e.g.

\emph default
 by unintentionally dropping columns, or by breaking primary-key-foreign-key
 constraints, or breaking normalization by duplicating data).
 A means of performing database schema migrations in an accident-free way
 is important.
 Defining a principled approach to table rewrites is even better.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The Functorial Query Language (FQL) provides such a principled approach.
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Spivak2014"
literal "false"

\end_inset

 It is reviewed below.
 The key observation here will be that data migration (database schema migration
) can be thought of as a form of rewriting, analogous to the idea of term
 rewriting or graph rewriting.
 Looked at more strongly, this is more than an analogy: table rewriting
 
\emph on
is
\emph default
 graph rewriting.
 The idea to be examined here is this: If one keeps the adjoint functors
 
\begin_inset Formula $\Sigma\dashv\Delta\dashv\Pi$
\end_inset

 of FQL, but discards the SQL tables on which they are founded, can the
 FQL approach provide a principled means for rewriting graphs? The answer
 appears to hinge on the question of how indexes are conceived of within
 the system, how they are maintained.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Data Migration and Graph Rewriting
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The concept of data migration in database practice refers to the idea that,
 after a system architect or data architect has designed some database,
 and a company has populated that database with millions of records, at
 the expense of millions of dollars, it is realized that the original design
 of the database schemas are inadequate to meet future business needs.
 The data needs to be migrated to a new set of schemas.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It is often the case that the data is so voluminous, and so valuable, that
 it will take months of system architect effort and weeks of management
 review before one can press the button and cross one's fingers, hoping
 that nothing is lost or corrupted.
 Mistakes are not hard to make: some important

 constraint might be accidentally dropped.
 Maybe some column will be forgotten about.
 Maybe normalization will be broken, resulting in duplicated data appearing
 in multiple tables, with no means of keeping that duplicated data in sync,
 leading to long-term data rot.
 It sure would be nice to do data migrations in a less time-consuming, less
 error prone fashion.
 This requires a principled approach; but how?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Well, what is data migration really, at the most abstract level? It is a
 graph rewrite.
 The initial database design should be understood to be a graph, with the
 various key constraints between tables being the directed edges of the
 graph.
 The revised database design, with its new table schemas, is a different
 graph.
 The goal of the data migration is to rewrite the first graph into the second.
 Data migration is in fact graph rewriting, but narrowly conceived.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Looked at this way, the situation is jarring.
 In the former case, data migration is a difficult, time-consuming manual
 process playing out at a human timescale.
 In the later case, any given graph rewriting system or term rewriting system
 is expected to do it's operations in milliseconds.

\begin_layout Plain Layout
See, for example, Maude,
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

\end_inset

 a term rewriting system that stands on it's own, disassociated from any
 other processing system.
\end_layout

\end_inset

 How is it these two scales are so different? 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The idea of doing data migrations in hours instead of days is radical; the
 idea of doing it automatically at millisecond speeds is revolutionary.
 Moving forward in the domain of knowledge representation requires bridging
 this gap.
 If one has data represented one way, one must be able to efficiently, rapidly
 and easily transform it into a different representation.
 Even more: for AGI, such rewrites must be fully automated and automatic.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To make data migration easy, one needs to be able to represent the graph
 rewrites within the system itself.
 Later sections will describe a metaquery system that accomplishes this.
 This is in contrast to the situation with SQL.
 The graph that is the schema of an SQL database is not itself stored in
 a table, nor is it queryable with SQL commands.
 When a DBA hand-crafts an SQL expression to perform a graph rewrite, they
 do not store that expression within the database itself; it exists externally,
 in a distinct location.
 By working with metagraphs, it turns out that it is not hard to craft a
 query system in which the queries themselves live as data within the database.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Graph Rewriting and Indexes
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The second part of automating rewrites of knowledge representation schemas
 is to provide a principled approach.
 One such principled approach can be found in the Functorial Query Language
 (FQL).

\begin_layout Standard
Basic definitions are in order.
 A database schema 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{C}$
\end_inset

 is a category.
 The objects of that category are the tables; the morphisms of that category
 are the indexes.
\begin_inset Foot

\begin_layout Plain Layout
More precisely, the category is the database schema; see Wikipedia 
\begin_inset Flex URL

\begin_layout Plain Layout

\end_layout

\end_inset

.
 This includes not just the tables and the indexes, but also all of the
 triggers, stored procedures, queues, views and other elements.
 For simplicity, we consider only the tables as the objects, and the integrity
 constraints (the indexes) as the morphisms.
 
\end_layout

\end_inset

 For example, given any particular row in some table, the index provides
 a map from that row to some other row in some other table.
 It provides the morphism between them.
 The morphisms are pointer-chases, in that both are composable: given some
 row, one can chase the pointer to some other row in some other table, and
 then repeat this again.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
An instance of a database is a functor 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{C}\to\mathbf{Set}$
\end_inset

.
 That is, the database schema 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{C}$
\end_inset

 itself is just the collection of empty tables, and the indexes between
 them.
 To populate a database with data, one must specify what goes into it.
 For example, given a table of employees, there is a corresponding set of
 employees that go into that table.
 The mapping is from 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{C}$
\end_inset

 to 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{Set}$
\end_inset

 and not the other way around, because it is 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

forgetful
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

: the morphisms in 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{Set}$
\end_inset

 are functions from one set to another, but they do not describe how the
 individual elements of the set are to be paired up: those relationships
 are forgotten.
 All that remains of the database index morphism is the idea that it connected
 one set to another, without specifying how the elements of the set are
 connected.

Two different database instances 
\begin_inset Formula $I$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $J$
\end_inset

 (for the same schema 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{C}$

) differ by the addition, deletion or modification of rows in various tables.
 The relationship between them can be phrased as a homomorphism: it maps
 tables to tables (obviously) and rows to rows.
 Deleted rows are mapped to the

 It is a non-trivial and worthwhile exercise to verify that two different

\end_layout

\end_inset

 This allows the category 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{C}\mbox{-}\mathbf{Inst}$
\end_inset

 to be defined, the objects of which are the instances 
\begin_inset Formula $I$

A schema mapping is a functor 
\begin_inset Formula $F:\mathcal{C}\to\mathcal{D}$
\end_inset

 from a database schema 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{C}$
\end_inset

 to 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{D}$
\end_inset

.
 To be a functor, it must provide maps between the objects of each: 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathit{tables}\left(\mathcal{C}\right)\to\mathit{tables}\left(\mathcal{D}\right)$
\end_inset

 and between the morphisms of each: 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathit{indexes}\left(\mathcal{C}\right)\to\mathit{index\mbox{-}paths}\left(\mathcal{D}\right)$
\end_inset

.
 A data migration is then a lifting of this functor 
\begin_inset Formula $F$
\end_inset

 to a functor on 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{C}\mbox{-}\mathbf{Inst}$
\end_inset

 to 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{D}\mbox{-}\mathbf{Inst}$
\end_inset

.
 The FQL paper points out there is not just one such lifting, but three:
 a contravariant functor 
\begin_inset Formula $\Delta_{F}$
\end_inset

 and it's left and right adjoints 
\begin_inset Formula $\Sigma_{F}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\Pi_{f}$
\end_inset

.
 The contravariant functor 
\begin_inset Formula $\Delta_{F}$
\end_inset

 is defined by composition with a particular database instance:
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{align*}
\Delta_{F}: & \mathcal{C}\mbox{-}\mathbf{Inst}\to\mathcal{D}\mbox{-}\mathbf{Inst}\\
 & I\mapsto\Delta_{F}I=I\circ F
\end{align*}

\end_inset

where a specific database instance 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
I:\mathcal{C}\to\mathbf{Set}
\]

\end_inset

is mapped to 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\Delta_{F}I:F\left(\mathcal{C}\right)\to\mathbf{Set}
\]

\end_inset

where (of course, by definition) 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{D}=F\left(\mathcal{C}\right)$
\end_inset

, and so one can write
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\Delta_{F}I:\mathcal{D}\to\mathbf{Set}
\]

\end_inset

 What's wrong with just writing it as a basic s-expression? It appears to
 be entirely unambiguous to just drop the colon and the comma.
 It becomes:

\begin_layout Plain Layout

	(e4 (e3 (e1 n1 n2) (e2 n2 n3) n1 (e2 n2 n3)) n3)
\end_layout

\end_inset

Can't get any shorter than that.
 This is not exactly an 'ordinary' s-expression, though.
 Key differences:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Every open-paren must be followed by a link '
\family sans
\size footnotesize
ek
\family default
\size default
': this is what a meta-edge must necessarily be.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Every node is globally unique.
 That is, each time the node '
\family sans
\size footnotesize
n2
\family default
\size default
' appears in this expression, it is exactly the same '
\family sans
\size footnotesize
n2
\family default
\size default
', instead of being a different instance.
 Referring back to the metagraph node table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand vpageref
reference "metagraph node table"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

, we see that there is only one true instance of '
\family sans
\size footnotesize
n2
\family default
\size default
': it just has one set of attributes on it.
 When parsing the s-expression, whichever apparent copy of '
\family sans
\size footnotesize
n2
\family default
\size default
' that we grab hold of, the attributes attached to it will be the same.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Every link is globally unique.
 For example, the sub-expression '
\family sans
\size footnotesize
(e2 n2 n3)
\family default
\size default
' appears twice; in both cases, it is exactly the same subexpression.
 This is clear by referring to the metagraph link table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand vpageref
reference "metagraph link table"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

: there is really just one copy.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We conclude that s-expressions offer a marvelous compact string representation
 for metagraphs.
 Yet one should not be mislead; these are not ordinary s-expressions.
 This will be further amplified below, when considering queries performed

The word 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

representation
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 For example, in group theory, one can talk about a specific group, as a

\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 One can also have a 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

matrix representation of a group
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 The matrix representation will also have additional properties and relationship

 Likewise here: there is the metagraph as the

 The s-expression has additional aspects to it that the metagraph does not

\begin_layout Subsection
UUID's
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Because each node and link is globally unique, it is very tempting, at this
 point, to say 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

oh, hey, just use universally unique identifiers
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 (UUID's).
 This is good enough for local address spaces; if nothing else, then an
 ordinary C/C++ pointer can be (effecitvely is) a UUID for the object.
 But, when writing a text string, what UUID shall one use? How should they
 be issued? Where should they be kept? These are difficult questions, with
 no easy or obvious answers.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It gets worse.
 What happens if there are two users, on opposite sides of the planet, and
 they need to issue a UUID for an Atom? This is a famous issue in computing:
 UUIDs cause major, fundamental problems when considering network-distributed
 storage.
 The problem is of UUID collision.
 One solution to avoid UUID collision is to have a single centralized atomic
 issuer of ID's that can guarantee uniqueness.
 This introduces a single, centralized bottleneck.
 Another solution is to use cryptographic hashes.
 Each meta-tree string can be hashed down to a number.
 To avoid collisions due to the birthday paradox, the hashes have to be
 quite large.
 For 1 million distinct atoms, a 64-bit hash and crossed fingers should
 be enough; uncrossing the fingers requires at least a 96-bit hash.
 For a trillion atoms, a 128-bit hash is just barely enough and a 192-bit
 hash is preferred.
 These eat up RAM (as compared to pointers) and the computation of cryptographic
 hashes requires significant CPU overhead.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Just how big is a 64-bit hash, vs.
 the expression it is standing in for? Well, 64-bits is 8 bytes.
 Suppose that the data that one was storing consisted of English words (there
 are about a million of them, if you include geographical place names, product
 and corporate names, historical events and a smattering of Latin and foreign
 loan-words.) The average length of these is about six letters, thus six
 bytes; seven if including the null terminator.
 How about the names of genes and proteins? These are not particularly lengthy
 either.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Ah, but tree structure!
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 you might think.
 All those parens, they need to be counted too! If you dump those plain-ASCII
 (plain-UTF8) s-expressions to a file, and then run gzip on it, or better
 yet, bzip2 or 7z, you find that those raw string s-expressions compress
 very well, outperforming by a wide margin the 64-bit UUID hash.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

But
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, you say, 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

we can't compress; the data lives in memory, not a file!
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 Ah, yes, this is true.
 The in-RAM representation is explosively larger than the string s-expression
 form.
 Reviewing the two tables 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand vpageref
reference "metagraph node table"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

, each appearance of a node or link in those tables must be a (64-bit) pointer.
 The example metagraph being worked here is two levels deep, and is quite
 'small'.
 Yet, counting the edges in the drawing of it, there are ten edges.
 Each edge is bidirectional: there are pointers going both ways; those 20
 pointers are required, or 
\begin_inset Formula $160=20\times8$
\end_inset

 bytes.
 Plus three bytes each for the null terminated strings '
\family sans
\size footnotesize
n1
\family default
\size default
', '
\family sans
\size footnotesize
n2
\family default
\size default
' ...
 '
\family sans
\size footnotesize
e1
\family default
\size default
', '
\family sans
\size footnotesize
e2
\family default
\size default
' for a total of 
\begin_inset Formula $160+24=184$
\end_inset

 bytes minimum.
 The string-length of the string '
\family sans
\size footnotesize
(e4 (e3 (e1 n1 n2) (e2 n2 n3) n1 (e2 n2 n3)) n3)
\family default
\size default
' is 48 characters: 48 bytes.
 The s-expression representation is four times more compact than the in-RAM
 representation!
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Finally, there is the problem of the UUID-to-meta-tree mapping.
 Where is it stored? New meta-trees could be added weeks or months later.
 Is there some UUID-to-meta-tree mapping service, live, available on-line
 24x7? What happens if it goes down? How is it kept unique? With locks?
 How many UUID's per second can be issued? What happens if it gets corrupted?
 Who has spare copies? Do byzantine generals show up and ruin the day? How
 much storage does this all require?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To conclude: having hashes around can be useful, as hashes are needed for
 hash tables.
 However, conceiving of them as if they were truly universally-unique ID's
 is problematic in a dozen different ways.
 By contrast, each and every s-expression really really is globally unique.
 There is only one of any given kind! No centralized authority was needed
 to issue this unique string! Anyone can mint it at any time, at very low
 cost! If forgotten, it can be recreated! And it's ASCII representation,
 compressed with bog-standard compression routines, is formidably tiny.
 UUID's are horrible; s-expressions are smart.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Insertion, Deletion and Mutability
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
When a metatree is added to a metagraph, a scan must be made to determine
 if the tree, or any subtree, already occurs in the metagraph.
 How might we know this? By looking it up! But where is this stored? 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
One concludes that there is really only one option: there has to be a mutable,
 top-level index that holds all of the meta-trees in the metagraph.
 In a sense, it is the one link to rule them all.
 Put differently, a metagraph store is, 
\emph on
de facto
\emph default
, just a store for one single mutable meta-tree.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The word 'mutable' was used several times in the last few sentences.
 This is important.
 For all other meta-trees, it is not only convenient to treat them as if
 they were immutable, it becomes a necessity.
 Returning to the example meta-tree:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset listings
lstparams "basicstyle={\footnotesize\sffamily},tabsize=3"
inline false
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout

	(e4 (e3 (e1 n1 n2) (e2 n2 n3) n1 (e2 n2 n3)) n3)
\end_layout

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Suppose one wishes to change 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

just one
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 of the '
\family sans
\size footnotesize
n3
\family default
\size default
's into an '
\family sans
\size footnotesize
n5
\family default
\size default
'.
 But which one? They are, after all, all the same '
\family sans
\size footnotesize
n3
\family default
\size default
', so if edited, they all change together, atomically.
 Suppose now that this meta-tree is a subtree of something larger and more
 complex.
 Performing an edit, changing the '
\family sans
\size footnotesize
n3
\family default
\size default
' into an '
\family sans
\size footnotesize
n5
\family default
\size default
' in this meta-tree requires examining the incoming set of this tree, and
 determining what to do in each case.
 This might be a non-trivial decision procedure.
 Should each of these larger trees get the new, modified version, or should
 they keep the original unmodified version? If the latter, then the unmodified
 version becomes 
\emph on
de facto
\emph default
 immutable, and the new, modified version just becomes a completely new
 meta-tree (
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

copy on write.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
So, immutable meta-trees are quite all right.
 Besides avoiding the decision problem of what to do with the incoming set,
 there are some much more mundane advantages.
 Immutable meta-trees can be traversed lock-free; there is no concern that
 one thread is traversing it, even as another thread is altering it.
 The importance of having small structures being lock-free cannot be overstated.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This all changes when one considers the top-most, master index.
 It 
\emph on
must
\emph default
 be mutable.
 It 
\emph on
must
\emph default
 be possible to add new trees, and remove stale ones from this master index.
 Otherwise, it cannot be called a database!
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Yet, oddly, this top-level index/table looks exactly like any other metatree.
 Yes, it's large: it may have many millions of (immutable) subtrees in it.
 But it itself is just another tree, and there is no particular reason why
 it cannot be the subtree of yet other trees.
 The only difference is that it is mutable.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Thus, we've identified two fundamentally different utilities, serving different
 purposes, yet both having the same structural form.
 The mutable form is a 'database'.
 The immutable form is the 'data'.
 In all other respects, they are the same.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Within the OpenCog system, the mutable form has been historically called
 the 'AtomSpace'.
 It can be stacked and nested and used to form linear or Y-shaped or diamond-sha
ped inheritance diagrams, however one wishes.
 The immutable Nodes and Links have been called 'Atoms', as a stand-in term
 for something that can be either a Node or a Link.

\begin_layout Subsection
Metagraph mutability vs.
 SQL table mutability
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There are two ways to delete a row from an SQL table.
 Either one already knows the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset


\family sans
\size footnotesize
\emph on
PRIMARY KEY
\family default
\size default
\emph default

\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 of that row, and one asks for that key to be deleted, or one does not.
 If one does not know, then one has to 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset


\family sans
\size footnotesize
\emph on
SELECT key FROM employees WHERE name='Agent Smith';
\family default
\size default
\emph default

\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 and present the resulting key to be deleted.
 Yes, of course, this can be done with a single statement: 
\size small

\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset


\family sans
\size footnotesize
\emph on
DELETE FROM employees WHERE name='Agent Smith';
\family default
\size default
\emph default

\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 but this only hides the fact that, without the key, nothing can be done.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In SQL, effectively all tables have a primary key: it is the master key
 for each row.
 For the discussion above, it is effectively the UUID of the row.
 As the 
\emph on
de facto
\emph default
 UUID of SQL systems, it suffers from all the UUID drawbacks previously
 reviewed.
 SQL databases are notoriously hard to shard across multiple network nodes.
 Consistency and atomic updates are hard: this is because there is effectively
 one centralized bottleneck for issuing and locking UUIDs.
 Such locks are needed during updates, even if only for the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

short
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 duration of the '
\family sans
\size footnotesize
COMMIT
\family default
\size default
'.
 This bottleneck, and the difficulty of resolving it, is the foundation
 stone on which the ACID vs.
 BASE debates are built.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
How does this compare to the one mutable index of all immutable meta-trees?
 Well, there are at least three 'obvious' ways in which the deletion of
 a meta-tree could be implemented.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
If the master index is a hash table or a tree of raw memory pointers, and
 one has the raw pointer to the memory to be deleted, the deletion can be
 immediately and directly performed.
 This is analogous to already knowing the primary key of an SQL table row.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
If the master index is a hash table or a tree of abstract indicators, and
 one has the abstract indicator of the meta-tree to be deleted, the deletion
 can be immediately and directly performed.
 Unlike the case of UUID's, there are abstract indicators that can be computed
 uniquely and in a relatively rapid fashion.
 An example of this is the Merkle tree.
 It is 'decentralized', in the sense that, no matter who has a copy of a
 given meta-tree, or where it might be located, everyone will agree as to
 what it's Merkle tree hash will be.
 It is not 'unique', in the sense that there might be hash collisions.
 However, for practical use in the database, being collision-free is not
 so important;
\begin_inset Foot
status collapsed

\begin_layout Plain Layout
It's not so important, because one does not blindly delete everything with
 the same hash.
 One first checks to verify that the right thing is being deleted.
 The hash only served to quickly find a small list of candidates.
 This is as always.
\end_layout

\end_inset

 being computable in a decentralized fashion is.
 It avoids the UUID/primary-key pitfall.
 This certainly turns the ACID vs.
 BASE debate a bit on it's side.
 The current actual OpenCog AtomSpace in-RAM implementation uses Merkle
 trees.

 of s-expressions, and one has the s-expression corresponding to the meta-tree
 to be deleted, the deletion can be immediately and directly performed.
 But it is already apparent that it is easy and cheap to compute (in a decentral
ized fashion) the s-expression corresponding to a meta-tree.
 This is effectively a variant of the above, where the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

abstract indicator
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 is the s-exp, instead of the Merkle tree.
 Given the earlier discussion concerning the size of s-expressions vs.
 the size of pointers, this is certainly a viable storage format for the
 in-RAM metagraph database.
 That it is not used by the current in-RAM AtomSpace is largely a historical
 accident.
 However, one of several of the current file-storage backends to the AtomSpace
 is RocksDB.
 That backend 
\emph on
does
\emph default
 use s-expressions as the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

primary key
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, and RocksDB itself is a kind of OKVS.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Metagraph insertion can be compared to SQL table insertion along the same
 lines.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As should be clear, there is not really all that much difference here, at
 least conceptually.
 The biggest and by far the most apparent difference is that SQL explicitly
 and overtly exposes UUIDs in the form of primary keys, thus dragging all
 that baggage along with it.
 By contrast, a metagraph store can keep all of this hidden, and has multiple
 implementation options for the analogous concept of a primary key: either
 Merkle trees, or s-expressions, or possibly something else.
 From the implementers point of view, this is nice: there are various possible
 implementations (and they are all hidden from the user! No backwards-compat
 concerns!)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This is also nice from the user's point of view: why mess with primary keys,
 if one doesn't have to? One less thing to think about, and not unrelated
 to the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

 nature of table normalization with metagraphs.
 Metagraphs provide automatic key maintenance.
 Nice!

 In a graph store, how, exactly is one supposed to say that 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

this vertex is the same as that vertex
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

? Finding a suitable solution is non-trivial; it requires either references
 or some other technique to indicate sameness.
 How is this to be managed in a graph store? If one is not careful, one
 finds oneself performing queries at the same time that one is inserting
 data.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There is a large variety of graph stores that are generally available.
 Each has unique API's and differing implementations.
 It is beyond the scope of this text to review them all.
 Thus, the answer to be supplied here is utterly opaque.
 How can one retro-fit this primary property of metagraphs, of global metatree
 uniqueness, onto a graph store? What's the answer? This section is short
 because the problem is a bit mind-boggling.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To conclude: we seem to have discovered, quite accidentally, with no explicit
 intent, that hypergraphs offer an elegant property that graph databases
 lack.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Query Languages and Graph Traversal
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The majority of popular query languages (QL) are modeled on SQL, taking
 SQL as not just an inspiration, but rather directly borrowing (stealing)
 most of its keywords and syntax.
 This is good, in that it makes it easy for users who are already familiar
 with SQL to learn the new system.
 This is good, in that it acts as a guidepost to the architect of the NewQL:
 if things get confusing, just take a look at how SQL did it, and make NewQL
 do it more-or-less the same way.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This is bad, in that, when the QL is to be applied to a new domain (such
 as graphs, hypergraphs or metagraphs), the mind-set that was suitable for
 table queries might not be appropriate for graphs.
 But this is not obvious: just half an hour with GraphQL documentation and
 examples will easily leave you with the impression that you can do anything
 you want with GraphQL.
 Got a graph? GraphQL can traverse it! That there might be some other way,
 maybe even a better way, never really enters your mind.

 is only one dotted arrow from 
\begin_inset Formula $e_{2}$
\end_inset

 to 
\begin_inset Formula $e_{3}$
\end_inset

, although there are two distinct downward links.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The back-pointers are needed to make the graph fully traversable; the need
 for this is the topic of this section.
 The back-pointers do eat up RAM; but this RAM usage has already been counted,
 in a previous section.
 Here, it is only the diagram that has been corrected to more appropriately
 show the actual situation.
 In actual implementations, the dotted arrows are weak pointers (as opposed
 to regular pointers).
 Weak pointers are required for memory management, whether through garage
 collection (GC), or through reference counting (RC) with smart pointers.
 Both kinds of systems (GC and RC) can only work with DAG's, and do not
 tolerate loops, as these cannot be freed.
 Yet, programmers sometimes need to create loops of pointers; thus, programming
 languages provide weak pointers for this use.
 That is what is shown here.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It is natural to use weak pointers for the incoming set, and regular pointers
 for the outgoing list.
 This is because, as observed earlier, metatrees must be immutable after
 they have been created.
 They cannot be edited; they can only be deleted.
 There is, however, one minor point of confusion, illustrated in the diagram
 below.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This shows that a new link 
\begin_inset Formula $e_{5}$
\end_inset

 has been added to the previous diagram.
 This is 
\emph on
not
\emph default
 an edit! The earlier tree, rooted at 
\begin_inset Formula $e_{4}$
\end_inset

, is completely unchanged.
 None of the regular pointers have changed.
 Two of the atoms 
\begin_inset Formula $e_{2}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $n_{3}$
\end_inset

 have enlarged incoming sets: they have gained a weak pointer each.
 That the original metatree has not changed can be most easily observed
 by the fact that it's corresponding s-expression is the same as before:
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset listings
lstparams "basicstyle={\footnotesize\sffamily},tabsize=3"

\begin_layout Plain Layout

	(e4 (e3 (e1 n1 n2) (e2 n2 n3) n1 (e2 n2 n3)) n3)

The diagram above shows two metatrees.
 The second one is
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset listings
lstparams "basicstyle={\footnotesize\sffamily},tabsize=3"
inline false

\begin_layout Plain Layout

	(e5 (e2 n2 n3) n3)
\end_layout

\end_inset

The new root 
\begin_inset Formula $e_{5}$
\end_inset

 points to two existing metatrees: 
\begin_inset Formula $e_{2}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $n_{3}$
\end_inset

; neither has been modified.
 The point here is that immutability does not conflict with creation and
 deletion.
 Creation and deletion do alter the weak pointers/incoming sets, but not
 the metagraph itself.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Queries and Tables
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
What do weak incoming sets have to do with queries? That they allow complete
 traversal of the metagraph is intuitively obvious: there are plenty-enough
 arrows (both regular and weak pointers) to be able to take walks from any
 Atom to any other.
 But are these really needed? The aim here is to show that the answer is
 'yes', they really are.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As an initial example, consider the metatree without the incoming-set pointers.
 Consider a tree-walk starting at 
\begin_inset Formula $e_{4}$
\end_inset

.
 Using conventional recursion techniques, it is easy to recurse (left to
 right) down to 
\begin_inset Formula $e_{3}$
\end_inset

 then 
\begin_inset Formula $e_{2}$
\end_inset

 and then 
\begin_inset Formula $n_{1}$
\end_inset

.
 Implemented as a stack machine, the next step is to pop, and then visit
 
\begin_inset Formula $n_{2}$
\end_inset

.
 The next stack pop brings us back to 
\begin_inset Formula $e_{3}$
\end_inset

 and traversal proceeds as normal.
 Nowhere in this stack machine recursion is it possible to visit 
\begin_inset Formula $e_{5}$
\end_inset

.
 If one has started at 
\begin_inset Formula $e_{4}$
\end_inset

, one cannot get to 
\begin_inset Formula $e_{5}$
\end_inset

.
 Worse: perhaps one's starting point was 
\begin_inset Formula $n_{1}$
\end_inset

.
 From there, one cannot get to anywhere, at least, not when there aren't
 any incoming-set pointers (the dotted lines).
\end_layout

A natural question to pose in this interpretation is

what schools does Rachel attend?

 Starting at 
\begin_inset Formula $n_{3}$
\end_inset

, one can trace upwards to find that Rachel attends both Wossamatta U.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
How might this have worked in conventional SQL? Well, for starters, we need
 something like this: 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset listings
lstparams "basicstyle={\footnotesize\sffamily},tabsize=3"
inline false
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout

	CREATE TABLE Schools (

\begin_layout Plain Layout

		course_id INT FOREIGN KEY,
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

		student_id INT PRIMARY KEY);
\end_layout

\end_inset

One continues in this fashion, creating a few more tables.
 Denoting that Joe assists in the Dean's Office and that Rachel assists
 in the School of Cosmetology poses a bit of a challenge.
 Perhaps this might do?

\begin_layout Standard

The need to denote employment adds a challenge to representing everything
 properly with tables, but is not relevant to the query about the schools
 that Rachel attends.
 Mostly, we just observe that, even for this rather simple graph, there
 already is a profusion of tables with some rather complex relationships
 between one-another.
 Textbooks insist that normalization is the correct thing to do; students
 often find that normalization is just plain hard.

 and then ...
 Well, obviously, we've left out a few details, in that 
\begin_inset Formula $e_{2}$
\end_inset

 Representing this properly requires a few more tables, and an additional

We've left out more than a few details.

OUTER JOIN
\family default
' and so on, all of which exist to allow the DBA to more carefully control
 and craft the nature of the graph walk needed, and how the data flows through
 the query, so that the query will run in an efficient, performant manner.
 The DBA really needs to actually think of what the query is doing (and
 to know the concepts, and to consult the documentation).
 I'd like to suggest that programming in SQL is like programming in assembly
 code, but for data.
 Perhaps it's time for a higher-level query language that abstracts away
 these details.
\end_layout

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This query works precisely because the DBA who is creating the query has
 a very concrete grasp of all of the tables involved, and is able to thread
 an explicit path between the tables.
 The reason that the SQL database engine can execute the query is because
 the DBA explicitly inserted 
\family sans
\size footnotesize
FOREIGN KEY

 constraints into appropriate locations.
 These foreign keys have the side effect of defining an index that manifests
 the dashed arrows in the metagraph diagram.
 The foreign keys are the dashed arrows.
 Not all of them; just some of them, only the ones that the DBA saw fit
 to add during the table design.
 Just like the dashed weak pointers allowed the metatree to be traversed
 upwards, so also the foreign keys allow the tables to be traversed

Query planning
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Query planning concerns the topic of how the database engine will actually
 perform the query.
 The above example was written in a fashion that highlights an obviously
 efficient and easy way to run the query.
 Start at the literal '
\family sans
\shape italic
\size footnotesize
Rachel
\family default
\shape default
\size default
', use the join '
\family sans
\shape italic
\size footnotesize
Students.name = 'Rachel'
\family default
\shape default
\size default
' and trace the dashed arrows upwards, to immediately arrive at the desired
 answer.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Of course, there is no guarantee that the SQL engine will actually do this.
 It might decide to start with '
\family sans
\shape italic
\size footnotesize
TABLE Schools
\family default
\shape default
\size default
', examine each school in turn, and then trace downwards from the top, until
 it eventually reaches Rachel, and is able to satisfy this final constraint.
 Table joins are a constraint satisfaction problem.
 Solving constraint satisfaction problems (CSP) is non-trivial;

\end_layout

\end_inset

 there is a vast literature devoted to this, both for the case of general
 CSP, and to the specific case of query planning.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Why would an SQL engine run this query in an unexpected or inefficient way?
 Well, the query planner may have decided that it is too expensive to create
 the dashed-arrow indexes.
 Without the dashed arrows, one obviously has to start at the top.
 Why would it decide that the dashed arrows are too expensive? Well, it
 might have looked at all the tables, noted that they are all very small,
 and that a direct downward-recursive query could be performed rapidly.
 Why splurge on indexes if the tables are small and directly searchable?
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There are also more mundane reasons to run the query top-down: the particular
 SQL engine may not even have much of a query planner.
 It might lack the sophistication to do anything fancy.
 The reality is that it is difficult to create a good SQL query planner.
 Not every system will take the effort.

 The influence of SQL in this query language is clear.
 Interestingly, OGRE was designed to be a database for s-expressions, and,
 as we've noted, s-expressions seem to make for an almost ideal representation
 for metatrees.
 So what's the catch? 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Well, the OGRE s-expressions are just that: strings.
 They are not metatrees; they are not interpreted as metatrees.
 They are interpreted only as ordinary, conventional abstract syntax trees.
 Because of this, there is no particularly compelling reason to automatically
 manage the incoming sets for these trees.
 Or rather, there is no particularly compelling reason, until one considers
 the implementation of the '
\family sans
\size footnotesize
JOIN
\family default
\size default
' keyword.
 In OGRE, there are no overt primary keys, and no foreign keys, so these
 need to be generated implicitly, as needed, to perform a query that joins
 together multiple s-expressions.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Does OGRE actually auto-create these primary-key/foreign-key relations,
 under the covers? Without looking at the implementation, it is hard to
 guess, but there are a few hints.
 OGRE works as follows.
 Each s-expression has the form
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset listings
lstparams "basicstyle={\footnotesize\sffamily},tabsize=3"
inline false
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout

	(<attribute-name> <v1> <v2> ...
 <vM>)
\end_layout

\end_inset

That is, the very first word appearing after the opening parenthesis has
 a special meaning.
 This is entirely conventional: in LISP/Scheme, the first word appearing
 after an opening parenthesis also has a very special significance.
 It is an operator.
 For our metatrees written as s-expressions, that first word is necessarily
 a Link.
 And so in OGRE, the first word is called the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

name of a proposition
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

; the subsequent words are the object (or subject) of the proposition.
\begin_inset Foot
status collapsed

\begin_layout Plain Layout
The word 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

proposition
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 is no accident.
 It is meant to make you think of propositional logic.
 This point will be returned to when we look at ProLog.
 It is notable that there is confusion between subject and object; that
 these are taken to be synonymous.
 In the general sheaf theory, subjects and objects are not synonymous; they
 correspond to different connector types.
 But this is a topic outside of the scope of the present text.

This last statement resembles a conventional table-database table declaration.

\begin_layout Plain Layout

	field-type ::= int | str | bool | float

\end_inset

The field type is explicitly a concrete type.
\begin_inset Foot
status collapsed

\begin_layout Plain Layout
This is a good time to start talking about type theory.
 The correct handling of metatrees requires recognizing that the first word
 following the open parenthesis, the so-called Link, is a 
\emph on
de facto
\emph default
 type-theoretical type.
 Perhaps there is some way for it to not be a type, but, as Sapir–Whorf
 suggests, it proves to be difficult to imagine how it could be anything
 other than a type.
 
\end_layout

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The need for explicit declarations, and the explicit identification of concrete
 types for fields, suggests that, under the covers, OGRE is building up
 all the machinery needed to perform table joins.
 Presumably this means the creation of the dashed-arrow incoming sets that
 are needed for upwards traversals.
 Or perhaps not: maybe the OGRE query planner always initiates queries top-down,
 starting at the uppermost declaration, and running a stack machine to perform
 recursive joins downwards.
 If one has well-defined tables, a top-down query would seem like a viable
 approach.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Note, by the way, that the declaration statement is of fixed length, and
 is 
\emph on
NOT
\emph default
 variadic! The declaration statement really is defining fixed-length records
 which can be placed into a completely conventional row-table.
 This is perhaps why the OGRE query language looks a lot like SQL: it has
 not departed from the table paradigm.
 It has merely slapped on a prettier API, prettier in the sense that the
 primary key and foreign key constraints have disappeared into the woodwork.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As a meta-comment about table declarations and queries: this all works fine,
 as long as one has a small number of declarations.
 A dozen, a few dozen, less than a hundred.
 Pondering the situation of a million different table declarations is ..
 imponderable, if one comes from an SQL background.
 Because: oh good lord, how could one ever write meaningful queries if there
 are a million tables? Can't even imagine.
 Why, one would need to write meta-queries to query tables, and perhaps
 query meta-tables of tables.
 If only there was a meta-query language to query meta-tables in recursively-org
anized meta-trees...
 oh wait, what?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We'll get back to you on that one.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In the meanwhile, it is important to observe that OGRE was designed to be
 a plugin for OCaML.
 A significant part of the query apparatus is defined in terms of OCaML
 and not in terms of s-expressions.
 Portions of the query are explicitly typed; many of the type declarations
 are functional-programming function arrows (in type theory, these go by
 the name of

Perhaps the most innovative aspect of the OGRE query language is that it
 is wrapped in a Kleisi triple (a Monad).
 Somewhat oddly, though, that monad seems to reinvent some subset of LISP,
 or at least of the SRFI-1 list iterators.
 This is perhaps not entirely unexpected: s-expressions do look like lists,
 and it is natural to want to do list operations on them.

The most notable difference is that the meta-query does not need to explicitly
 name the '

 Indeed, the metagraph does not have a '

 (see

.) In brief: with the free theory, you can freely 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

write down anything
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, as long as the parenthesis balance.
 Both s-expressions and the Datalog subset of Prolog can be taken to be
 examples of free theories.
 The theory of pure equality adds the equals sign, and says 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

you can write down anything
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, as long as the parenthesis balance and you also take transitive closures
 of the things that are equated.
 Problems of consistency first show up here, as it is possible to write
 down nonsense and paradoxes using equals signs.
 Relational algebra (
\emph on
e.g.

\emph default
 SQL) is the theory where you can 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

write down anything
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, but you can also use relations between things.
 Each relation corresponds to an SQL table.
 That relation is 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

true
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 if the corresponding row exists in the SQL table, else it is 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

false
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

; thus relations are sometimes called predicates.
 A pure relational algebra, without equality, is not quite interesting enough
 to be practical.
 As all of these examples show, you need to fold in the theory of equality
 in order to perform table joins.
 The equals sign just says 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

this variable appearing in this predicate is equal to this other variable
 or constant appearing in some other predicate
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\end_inset

 The SQL statement has implicit variables in it: the expression '
\family sans
\size footnotesize
Students.course_id
\family default
\size default
' is meant to be understood as a variable, ranging over all possible values
 of '
\family sans
\size footnotesize
course_id
\family default
\size default
' in the '
\family sans
\size footnotesize
Students
\family default
\size default
' table.
 The '
\family sans
\size footnotesize
Courses.uuid
\family default
\size default
' is another implicit variable.
 The equals sign is needed, because of the way that the variables appeared
 implicitly.
 There is no other way of saying 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

hey, these two variables are really the same thing
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, and thus the concept of table joins is born.

The complexity of table joins is in part a side-effect of the complexity
 of the theory of equality.
 You might think that equality seems pretty darned easy; it's just equals
 signs, right? Contemplating the complexity of SQL table joins, and the
 complexity of SQL query planners in planning table joins should quickly
 disabuse you of the idea that 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

 It's hard.

 The meta-query made use of the property of meta-graphs that any given Atom
 is always the same Atom.
 That is, the '

 There is no explicit need for equality.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A third fundamental difference is that the metaquery did not require any
 prior table definition.
 The situation is thus quite different than the aforementioned OGRE QL.
 Thanks to the implicit presence of the dashed arrows, there is no need
 to explicitly define indexes (i.e.
 there is no '
\family sans
\size footnotesize
CREATE INDEX ON Students(name);
\family default
\size default
' which would be needed if we wanted to have fast-running SQL queries on
 student names.
 The primary keys, of course, did not need explicit index declarations.)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A fourth fundamental difference is that the metaquery is itself a metatree.
 It does not live outside of the system of metagraphs.
 It does have a peculiar syntax and a collection of syntax rules (
\emph on
i.e.

\emph default
 it must begin with '
\family sans
\size footnotesize
Meet
\family default
\size default
', it must have some variable declarations and use the '
\family sans
\size footnotesize
Present
\family default
\size default
' link, and so on) but that syntax is a sub-language within the language
 of free s-expressions.
 The fact that the metaquery is itself a metatree opens the possibility
 of querying for queries.
 This may sound utterly absurd, but is in fact very commonplace in chat-bots
 and rule engines! This is expanded on, in the next section.

\begin_layout Standard
More formally: The query implicitly demands that the variables should be
 grounded.
 The variables are to be grounded by Atoms, which may be either Nodes or
 Links.
 In the case of Links, these are (by definition) metatrees themselves, and
 so the grounding matches a variable to a subgraph.
 The collection of subgraphs must be those specified in the '

 a truth value, whereas a menu-choice returns the chosen item.
 Choice commonly appears as a fragment of intuitionist logic and of linear

Since metatrees can be written as s-expression strings, and since metaqueries

 is just constant strings that can be matched verbatim.
 Unfortunately, this is not the case.

In the s-expression for a metatree, when a sub-expression is repeated, it
 is understood to be the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

same subexpression
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, 
\emph on
i.e.

\emph default
 the same Atom.
 There is no such guarantee in a string match: the first occurrence of a
 subexpression could be matched one way, and a second occurrence a different
 way, possibly with a conflicting match.
 Thus, if string pattern matching were to be used, it would need to be enhanced
 with some sort of conflict-free subterm matching.
 But how to implement this? That line of thinking seems to lead down the
 path of reinventing metatrees, but in an application-specific setting.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Practical metatree matching requires the ability to match into unordered
 collections (sets).
 This means that each and every permutation of an unordered set must be
 attempted during the match.
 String pattern matchers conventionally cannot do this.
 When they can, there is often no ability to handle nested unordered sets,
 subterms of which might need to be identical in the aforementioned conflict-fre
e fashion.
 That is, if a variable occurs in multiple places in multiply-nested unordered
 sets, and it is grounded one way in a specific permutation of one set,
 it must be grounded exactly the same way in all permutations of all other
 sets in which it occurs.
 This is the 'conflict resolution' aspect.
 How can this be accomplished? Well, one can use either metatrees, or one
 can use a 'theory of equality'.
 But, as noted above, the theory of equality provides it's own challenges
 to implementation: it introduces brand new conflict resolution issues that
 are difficult to resolve.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Practical metatree matching needs to provide menu-choice alternatives for
 subterms: one could match this or this or this.
 The choice can be buried arbitrarily deep in the pattern.
 As a string pattern matcher proceeds left-to-right through the string,
 and encounters a choice, it must explore each and every choice, individually.
 That means that it must backtrack if some given choice fails to match.
 Backtracking means that the pattern matcher must be implemented as a stack
 machine (because partial matches are held in a score-board, and that score-boar
d must now be placed on a stack).
 So, two issues here.
 First: regexes correspond to finite state machines, whereas stack machines
 correspond to context-free languages.
 So already, with choice, we've left the (simple, fast, direct) domain of
 regexes and finite state machines.
 Second: if the implementation of the pattern matcher is forcing you to
 think recursively, then why are you still thinking 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

strings
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

? Why not think in terms of trees, which is what recursion (and context
 free languages) really are? Once one has entered that domain, it is easier
 to conceptualize in terms of graphs, than strings.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Practical metatree matching requires the ability to quote and unquote significan
t keywords in the pattern.
 For example, one might want to search for all expressions that contain
 the term '
\family sans
\size footnotesize
Variable
\family default
\size default
' in it.
 Obviously, this would have to be quoted (say, as '
\family sans
\size footnotesize
(Quote (Variable ?x?))
\family default
\size default
') as otherwise, the variable would be interpreted as a variable in the
 pattern, instead of a constant term to be matched.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Practical metatree matching requires the ability to match lambda expressions.
 This requires the ability to find bound variables, and not only treat them
 as constants, but also to alpha-rewrite them.
 Consider, for example, the lambda expression 
\begin_inset Formula $\lambda x.\left(x+2\right)$
\end_inset

 written as a metatree: '
\family sans
\size footnotesize
(Lambda (Variable $x) (Plus (Variable $x) (Number 2)))
\family default
\size default
'.
 This expression is obviously equivalent to 
\begin_inset Formula $\lambda y.\left(y+2\right)$
\end_inset

 or '
\family sans
\size footnotesize
(Lambda (Variable $y) (Plus (Variable $y) (Number 2)))
\family default
\size default
'.
 The formal name for this kind of equivalence is 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

alpha equivalence
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
 Any pattern that is searching for lambdas that involve '
\family sans
\size footnotesize
Plus
\family default
\size default
' and the number 2 must be able to determine the alpha-equivalence of the
 match to the pattern.
 This is no longer a simple string match: the pattern matcher needs to be
 aware that '
\family sans
\size footnotesize
Lambda
\family default
\size default
' is a special keyword that binds its variable declarations.
 It needs to know that bound variables can be alpha-rewritten.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
After reading the above, the reader might feel as if there was a bit of
 a bait-n-switch performed with the pattern matching requirements.
 Some deeper thinking would have avoided this impression.
 The overall topic of this text is that metagraphs are suitable for generic
 knowledge representation.
 This means representing not only 'simple' graphs and metagraphs, but also
 quotidian systems like ontologies, phylogenies, first-order logic, Bayesian
 networks, lambda calculus, probabilistic programs, functional programs,
 declarative programs, genes, proteins, chemistry, natural language, visual
 objects, sounds, 3D spaces, ...
 As such, a knowledge representation system has to be practical and utilitarian,
 useful as a tool for the day-to-day knowledge worker.
 Thus, funny business like quotes and lambdas and alpha-rewrites and unordered
 sets must necessarily enter into the picture, and be supportable in the
 query system.
 Users ask for these things, users want them.
 You can't say no to users and expect them to come back.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Note, by the way, that the goals of a knowledge representation system resemble
 the goals of set theory or topos theory for mathematics: generic frameworks
 on which it is hoped that all of mathematics can be founded.
 Knowledge representation is likewise foundational.
 It is no accident that knowledge representation must borrow or steal ideas
 from topos theory, ideas such as sheaf theory.
 Sheaves are actually useful in mathematics.
 At this time, it is not yet widely understood that sheaves are also useful
 in knowledge representation.
 But we wander off-track, here; this is a different topic, covered in other
 texts in this series.

\begin_layout Subsection
Query Analysis
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Graphs may include equality predicates.
 In rare cases, these can be statically analyzed, without performing a query.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A full-fledged query language can include evaluatable predicates to accept
 or reject a particular grounding.
 During the analysis phase, these are set aside into a distinct bucket.
 They cannot be grounded (by definition), they can only be evaluated after
 a grounding is found.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Some evaluatable predicates, such as 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

less than
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, may cause a graph to fall apart into disjoint, disconnected components
 that are bridged only by evaluatable terms.
 During the analysis phase, the connected components must be identified
 and set aside.
 During evaluation of the query, each connected component is grounded separately
, and then brought together, to evaluate 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

less than
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 on the resulting groundings.
 Evaluatable terms, such as 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

less than
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, act as a filter on the Cartesian product of the components.
 Terms such as logical-or act on the disjoint union of the components.
 That is, both pi-type and sigma-type arrangements of disjoint components
 are possible.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A full-fledged query language can include an '
\family sans
\size footnotesize
Absent
\family default
\size default
' predicate, indicating one or more clauses that must be absent in the dataset,
 in order for the query to be satisfied.
 Such clauses are extracted and set aside during the analysis phase.
 They resemble evaluatable clauses, but have their own distinct peculiarities.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A full-fledged query language can include an '
\family sans
\size footnotesize
Always
\family default
\size default
' predicate, required to be present in not just one grounding, but in every
 grounding.
 They resemble evaluatable clauses, but they cannot be evaluated until after
 all possible groundings have been obtained (They can fail early, though.)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Query Planning
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The most basic query planning involves choosing a starting point for a graph
 walk.
 Thanks to the incoming set, the query can be started anywhere.
 However, it is advantageous to start the graph walk at the thinnest, most
 distant part of the graph, so that it does not need to be regularly revisited.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Sometimes, finding a starting point this way is impossible, because the
 query consists entirely of variables.
 In other cases, a query may consist entirely of evaluatable terms, which,
 by definition, are not groundable, but only evaluatable.
 These cases must be dealt with.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Queries may consist of multiple disconnected components; these must be individua
lly grounded, and then reassembled with pi-type or sigma-type bridges between
 them.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It is advantageous to borrow some ideas from SAT solving, and prune simple
 trees from the query, before performing an exhaustive search of a multiply-conn
ected tight nucleus.
 The pruned trees can be re-attached later.
 Equivalently, they might only need to be pattern-matched once.
 In this case, pruning is equivalent to maintaining a cache of pattern matches
 achieved earlier during traversal.
 (That is, a recursive graph walk will typically revisit certain parts of
 the graph.
 But if those parts have already been grounded, they do not need to be revisited
 again; it is sufficient to have a cache of the groundings.)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The OpenCog query engine makes use of these query optimizations.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Attributes (Tags)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This text opened with an extended discussion of attributes, and about how
 attributes are attached to the nodes and vertexes of a graph.
 This is still the case, still a desirable thing to do, when working with
 metagraphs.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

But why?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 you may wonder, 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

why can't everything be encoded as as metagraph? Why are attributes needed?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Well, of course, everything can be encoded as a metagraph.
 However, there's a cost; several costs, actually.
 One cost is that metatrees are immutable.
 If one has a list of 100 floating point numbers, and wishes to change the
 42nd one, it seems like overkill to be blocked from doing so by immutability.
 One might like to have something mutable, for this kind of a low-level
 vector.
 Another cost is the weak pointer (the dashed arrow).
 There is no particular need to maintain an incoming set for each floating
 point in a list.
 It is unlikely that two different Links will share the same floating point
 number (to all of it's glorious 18 decimal places!? Really?) It is unlikely
 that there will ever be any need for a query to traverse backwards (through
 the incoming set) of that float.
 Traversing forward into the vector of floats is plenty enough, if the only
 query decision to be performed is greater-then, less-than on some arithmetic
 ops on those numbers.
 Saving some RAM by not storing the weak pointers is a laudable thing do
 to.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If the attributes are stored as key-value pairs (KVP), then the attributes
 on any given Atom can be understood conceptually as a key-value database
 per Atom.
 This might feel like overkill, but it isn't really any different from graph
 databases in general.
 If a vertex or an edge of a graph has some attributes attached to it, then
 those attributes can be thought of as residing in a database specific to
 that edge or vertex.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In the present case, there is one fun little twist: if the KVP's are hierarchica
l, 
\emph on
i.e.

\emph default
 a tree, then they can be thought of as a special case of a metatree (as,
 indeed, trees are special cases of metatrees), but it is a metatree that
 is shorn of it's weak back-pointers, and thus can be mutable.
 One saves RAM and regains the mutability that was lost.
 The price to be paid is that such attributes are no longer searchable.
 (More precisely, they are no longer searchable except by brute force exhaustive
 search.
 The weak pointers acted as local indexes; without the ability to do an
 index lookup, brute force exhaustive search is all that one has left.)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The OpenCog AtomSpace supports attributes in the form of KVP trees.
 It has made one unfortunate naming choice for these attribute trees: they
 got called 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Values
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 with a capital V.
 This naming choice forces all sorts of contortions when one wants to talk
 about ordinary values with a lower-case v.
 The naming choice was arrived at under the influence of model theory, where
 a clear distinction is made between sentences of a language and their valuation.
 In model theory, and in logic, sentences are assigned 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

truth values
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
 Historically, these are crisp true/false values.
 But in Bayesian belief networks and in Markov logic networks, these valuations
 are given floating-point probabilities as their truth values.
 On OpenCog, these were historically called TruthValues, written in CamelCase.
 When generalized to arbitrary KVP valuations, they become Values.
 A better name might have been Attributes or Tags, as they are treated as
 ...
 attributes, or tags.

Chatbots, Rule Engines and Inverted Queries
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Here's something SQL cannot do: it cannot search for SQL.
 Absurd, right? One of the early chatbot technologies is called SRAI (Stimulus-R
esponse AI), and the scripting language for SRAI is known as AIML (AI Markup

A metagraph-style query language can easily support both queries and inverted

 and it does not particularly care about the types of the Nodes and Links
 that it is matching, as long as it is able to match.
\end_layout

Because metatrees contain both the forward pointers and the weak pointers
 pointing backwards, they effectively have a trie (prefix tree) built in.
 That is, the organizational advantages of using prefix trees to perform
 rapid string-matching searches come

The answer appears to be that it is a type, a type-theoretical type.
 This is not a proclamation or a theoretical result, this is an experimental

 After working with meta-trees for a decade, and examining how they represent

Could this could be reduced to just one type, by replacing Nodes with nullary

 Nodes need to be distinguishable, and thus are given unique string names.
 There is no particular need to give a Link a string name: it's outgoing

This is eerily similar to atomic physics.

 unless they appear in an organic molecule.
 That is, it is the relationship of elementary particles to one-another
 that gives structure to the universe.
 It is not the particles themselves.

For many (but not all) of these Nodes and Links, it became convenient to
 create a corresponding C++ class that performs some function.
 A silly example is the PlusLink: when this is executed, the arguments are
 added together, if the arguments are numeric.
 The C++ class performs this addition.
 Now, it is generally regarded that C++ classes are types.
 By extension, PlusLink must also be a type.

 New types can be introduced at any time.
 It doesn't even make sense to talk of a

 There is a long-running REPL loop, and nothing is gained by preventing

As a practical example: Nodes and Links are of type Atom.
 The biology subsystem uses GeneNodes and ProteinNodes, since these are
 useful for biological data representations.
 These are also type Atom.
 The biology subsystem is a distinct subsystem, and not part of the core:
 it is dynamically loaded.
 This creates issues for the OCaml binding, which might have known about
 Atoms at compile time, but had no clue about GeneNodes and ProteinNodes
 at compile time.
 Static types and metatree types do not play well together.

The second bullet point above idly wondered about a monotyped system, where

 In conventional computer programming, ints, floats and strings are types

\begin_inset Quotes erd

\begin_inset Quotes eld

product types

).
 Function calls have a type signature too, this is the arrow type, pointing
 from the input arguments to the output type.
 The ML, CaML, Haskell, Scala and F# programming languages provide an explicit
 type system, allowing the programmer to define new types (In OO languages,
 new types can only be defined by defining a new OO class).

Before proceeding further, a reference example will help clarify the idea.
 Consider the English language sentence 
\emph on

\begin_inset Quotes eld

\emph default
 This encodes some information; how might it be encoded as a metagraph?

This clearly has the Link-Node structure of a metatree; but appears to be
 using some derived types.
 The denotational semantics is obviously that of the English language sentence;

 This is not laziness on the part of the writer: the word

 There is freedom in how this can be done; there is nothing in the metatrees

\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Dynamic Typing
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In a metagraph, the concept of a primitive type appears to be fluid; new
 types are naturally definable by means of type inheritance.
 By 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

primitive
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, it is meant a type that is not built with one of the usual type constructors:
 a list constructor, a function-type constructor, a product (pair) constructor.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There does not seem to be any need to prevent the creation of new types
 at runtime.
 This is in contrast to statically-typed programming languages.
 Languages such as OCaml demand static typing so that type inference can
 be done at compile time.
 After a module has been compiled, the resulting binary has an API with
 fixed types in the interface.
 This provides safety: the user cannot call into the binary with bogus arguments
, leading to undefined behavior or crashes.
 In that sense, static types 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

make sense
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 for compiled programming languages.
 The case is different here: with metagraphs, the primary goal is not programmin
g but data representation.
 Metagraphs don't 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

do anything
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, they are not an 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

executable program
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, they just 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

exist
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
 At least this particular reason for static type-safety seems to disappear.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Once a type has been defined, it does not seem reasonable to allow it to
 be re-defined.
 Re-definition of a type risks corrupting the meaning, if not the actual
 structure of the data held in the metagraph.
 For example, one would not want to redefine CatNode to allow the description
 of fish; existing assertions about fur and tails become invalidated.
 Thus, types are immutable: they can be created, they can be destroyed;
 they cannot be altered.

Jigsaw Puzzle Pieces and Sheaves

Caution: the idea of Lambdas, and of Arrows, while extremely widespread
 in programming practice, is the source of tremendous confusion and difficulty

 Even worse: just as fish are unaware of water, most programmers are unaware
 of alternatives to lambdas.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There is one extremely important alternative, discussed in other texts in

 Telegraphically: if one has a function

 and beta-reduces it with 42 to get 
\begin_inset Formula $f\left(42\right)$
\end_inset

\begin_inset Formula $x$
\end_inset

 in 
\begin_inset Formula $f\left(x\right)$

 to the jigsaw-puzzle tab 42.

The two pieces can be connected together only if the connector types match:
 the slot and the tab must have matching types but opposite sexes.
 This ensures the type-safety of beta-reduction.
 Observe the coloring of the vertexes in the above diagram.
 At the bottom, there are two black (

 At the top, the open-colored vertexes are (unconnected) 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

connectors
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, and the edges are 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

half-edges
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, not yet fully formed until the connection is made.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Full-fledged jigsaw puzzle pieces can connect in every-which way (provided
 that the tabs and slots are correctly mated).
 This is more general than term algebras, in which term trees are always
 DAGs.
 That is, a lambda is an anonymous term, an arrow is a component of a term
 tree.
 For computer programming (functional or imperative), one thinks about calling
 functions and methods with arguments, leading to the notion of an abstract
 syntax tree.
 Function calls and arrow types naturally construct trees, or, more generally,
 DAGs.
 Graphs with loops, or graphs with undirected edges do not naturally occur
 in lambda calculus or functional programming.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For knowledge representation, it does not have to be that way.
 The directionality of the arrow can be discarded, and mating can be indicated
 with the connectors themselves.
 That is, the ArrowLink is a special case of a more general jigsaw-puzzle-piece
 link:

 There is no particular need to restrict to such heterosexual connection
 types or mating rules.
 One can have a single sex, which, when connected, gives undirected edges.
 One can have three or more sexes, with peculiar mating rules for which
 can attach to which.
 Natural examples occur in chemistry (bonds), in biochemistry (reactomes),
 in biology (mating types of fungii) and in medicine (infectious disease
 transmission.) Examples from computer science include polymorphic types.
 A particularly strong example comes from linguistics: the Link Grammar,
 where the notion of jigsaw puzzle pieces is made explicit.

What is the point of all of this? It is to reformulate or generalize the
 notion of beta reduction and functional programming into a general setting,
 more sutiable for general knowledge prepresentation.
 One can, of course, fall back to earlier concepts of a directed edge, and
 represent everything in terms of vertices and edges.
 But the shortfalls of a conventional graph representation have already
 been discussed: not just representational shortfalls, but also algorithmic
 issues, with RAM and CPU consumption.
 The point of the jigsaw puzzle paradigm is that it provides locality of
 data and ease of assembly.
 Partially assembled jigsaws obey the sheaf axioms.
 Sheaves are generically useful for representing knowledge.

\begin_layout Standard
As such, some metatrees can serve a dual purpose: both to record syntactic
 structure, and to be executable.
 Perhaps this feels painfully obvious at this point; if this is the case,
 it should be contrasted to the situation of programming in lisp or scheme.
 First of all, in lisp, one is programming, not representing data.
 The source code for lisp programs resides in files, not in databases.
\begin_inset Foot
status collapsed

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Let's not be silly.
 Of course one could stick the source code into a database.
 But how would you write a query to get it back out, and evaluate it? In
 lisp? Well, yes, of course, one could write some wrappers to do that.
 So what? Are you representing knowledge yet? Did you create a knowledge
 query system?
\end_layout

\end_inset

 In the end, a lisp program is always executable (evaluatable); if it is
 not, that is because it is broken in some way (or you just quoted the whole
 thing).
 This is not the case here: there is nothing about metatrees that makes
 them inherently evaluatable or executable.
 Indeed, the above fragment is not executable until the variables are bound
 to some values.
 Worse, its ambiguous as to what should happen if a is not greater than
 b.
 As a program, it is not really valid.
 As a metatree, it is as good as any other, differing only in having the
 hint of being possibly, potentially evaluatable.

A subset of metatrees can be considered to be a programming language.

 Macros run on source expressions, and they expand the source expression
 into something evaluatable.
 That is, macro languages allow the programmer to define a set of rewrite
 rules to transform input syntax trees into output syntax trees.
 However, conceived of as macros, they can only be run once, during a pre-proces
sing stage; they cannot be run later, once the resulting program has started
 executing.
 In this sense, they are limited in a way that fexprs are not.

\begin_layout Standard
What is new here is that, if the metagraphs are represented as s-expressions,
 some of those s-expressions are potentially evaluatable, and thus lisp-like.
 Unlike conventional lisp, the evaluation system must live in harmony with
 the term rewriting system; thus, enabling the evaluation of metatrees seems
 to require some sort of clearly defined fexpr or $vau interfaces in the
 evaluator.

ProLog
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
An alternative to the lisp/scheme fexpr/$vau mindset is provided by ProLog.
 It is both a programming language, in that ProLog programs are executable,
 and it is a knowledge store, in that the Datalog fragment of ProLog is
 explicitly intended to store data.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
ProLog makes abstract syntax trees explicit: it is hard to understand how
 prolog works, unless one learns to think in terms of trees.
 Certainly, the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

cut operator
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 in prolog is one of the early stumbling blocks for programmers learning
 prolog.
 It's hard to see what it does, until one realizes that it is literally
 cutting branches off of a tree.
 At the same time, chapter one, the very first chapter of any book on prolog
 programming is rife with examples of knowledge representation.
 One will find something like this:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset listings
lstparams "basicstyle={\footnotesize\sffamily},tabsize=3"

\begin_layout Plain Layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

		sibling(X, Y) :- parent_child(Z, X), parent_child(Z, Y).
\end_layout

\end_inset

The first two statements are assertions of fact, the third is a inference
 rule.
 They have a very obvious representation as trees, and, more precisely as
 meta-trees.
 Yet, strangely, prolog programs are encoded in text files, and 
\emph on

 as a collection of entries in a graph database!
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This last observation becomes truly bizarre, if one imagines some non-trivial
 knowledge representation problem.
 Imagine keeping census data in prolog.
 Maintaining a text file with dozens of lines of code per person, for millions
 of people is absurd.
 Applying transformations or graph rewrites is impossible for text files.
 Consider the inference

 These are somewhat like assembly code, but abstract, and not specific to

 Looking carefully, one will observe that 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

compiler optimization
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 actually consists of a very small database of the currently active, non-retired
 abstract syntax trees, and that optimization is a collection of re-write
 rules (in the sense of the prolog rewrite rule, above) being applied to
 the trees in the active database.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Of course, what happens inside a compiler is very narrow, and very carefully
 crafted to suit the needs of the compiler, and nothing more.
 This is a high art that has been honed over many decades.
 Intermediate languages are almost never written to disk, except during
 debugging, when they are presented to the programmer as text strings.
 Yet the lessons they teach can be taken as generic: creating graphs, and
 then transforming them, via graph re-writing, is a generically useful operation.
 Representing knowledge as trees, and specifically, as typed meta-trees,
 offers a huge representational efficiency over plain graphs or SQL tables
 or key-value stores.
 The efficiency is both computational (RAM usage, CPU cycles) and expressive:
 writing inferences in prolog really is a lot easier than writing SQL statements.

Human-oriented vs.
 Machine-oriented
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
ProLog is a human-oriented programming language.
 It is expected that humans are going to write prolog, and thus the language
 features are designed to be easy for humans to manipulate.
 In this sense, it is like almost all programming languages – almost all,
 but not all.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The intermediate languages are not human-oriented, but machine oriented.
 It is not expected that programmers will be writing in intermediate languages,
 no more than they are expected to write in assembly code.
 Intermediate languages are designed to be easy to use by machines: specifically
, by the internal algorithms of compilers.
 A compiler needs to turn high-level languages into assembly code.
 The resulting assembly code should run fast; but how to perform the optimizatio
n, the rearrangement of terms that enables fast assembly? Some compiler
 optimizations can be done directly on the input source: for example, loop
 hoisting.
 Some compiler optimizations can be done directly on the assembly: for example,
 peephole optimizations.
 The vast majority of desirable program transformations cannot be done in
 either the source language or the target language.
 This is why intermediate languages exist.
 Intermediate languages are fine-tuned to make it easy for algorithms to
 read and write them.
 They are designed for machines, and not for people.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It appears that any kind of programming language constructed from raw metatree
 s-expressions is more machine friendly than it is human-friendly.
 The example abstract syntax tree given earlier,

 as well as some lesser efforts (a chatbot triplestore).
 Doing so defeats the machine-readability of the s-expressions themselves.
 Much of the primary utility of using metatrees comes from being able to
 apply graph rewriting rules to them.
 A graph rewrite rule consists of a pattern template to be matched, and
 the resultant transformation.
 When the template is an s-expression, of the kind given in the section
 on MetaQuery Language, then it is easy to match.
 When it is something else, the application of the pattern rules becomes
 difficult.
 The pattern language can no longer be simple, and worse, the pattern language
 diverges from the source language itself.
 The s-expression form seems to hit a happy medium: the pattern language
 is a valid subset of the whole language.
 It is easy to parse, making it ideal for algorithmic manipulation.
 It is too low-level to make it comfortable for humans; but given that we
 live in a machine age, this is perhaps a not unexpected twist.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This text started out as an attempt to describe the RAM and CPU usage properties
 of metagraphs, and unwittingly turned into a strong statement about the
 general utility of metagraphs as a foundational system.
 As such, it provides a strong statement about many of the design decisions
 that went into the OpenCog AtomSpace, which is the primary research vehicle
 for these ideas.
 Even so, it is not the culmination of the journey.
 Work with metagraphs has lead to the concept of sheaves, hinted at here
 with the

 Sheaves have distinct representational properties, including CPU and RAM
 usage.

 a decade of implementation and use experience behind it.
 This text gives a flavor of where it has arrived.
