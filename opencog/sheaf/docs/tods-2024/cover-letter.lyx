\emph on
The second revision of this text has benefited from the (witting or unwitting)
 helpful input of Amirouche Boubekki, Kino Coursey, John Cowan, Marc Nieper-Wi√ük
irchen, Adam Vandervorst and Steven Wiley.
 Absolutely none of this would have been possible without a decade's worth
 of gracious support and tutelage of Ben Goertzel.

\begin_layout Paragraph
Conflicts of Interest:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I am not aware of any potential conflicts of interest with any potential
 reviewer; my work is sufficiently removed from the mainstream, that it
 is unlikely that I will have had prior contact with potential reviewers.
 Any exceptions would be employees of Singularity.AI, associates of the OpenCog
 Foundation and users of and contributors to the OpenCog system.
 Among these are various grad students and professors; to the best of my
 knowledge, knowing their fields of expertise and interest, it is unlikely
 that they would be chosen as reviewers.
 These are not database geeks.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Paragraph
Well-known or Unique Systems:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The OpenCog system is well-known.
 It is an open source project, with hundreds of contributors.
 I am one of the more prominent and active contributors; some quality time
 with a search engine, together with some basic sleuthing common-sense,
 would quickly narrow things down to my being the likely author.
 I don't live under a bushel.

\begin_layout Paragraph
Prior Publication:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This work has been disseminated to a small number of people; primarily,
 the employees at Singularity.AI and associates of the OpenCog Foundation.
 In it's original form, it was meant to be a limited techical report; but
 there have been repeated suggestions that it should be published in a prominent
 journal.
 The techical report can be found on github, as a part of project documentation.
