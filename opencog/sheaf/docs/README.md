Theoretical Papers
==================
This directory contains an alternative, more rigorous, more precise
description of what the code below is all about. Its under construction
and very incomplete, just right now.

There are several files here:
* The [sheaves.pdf](sheaves.pdf) file. It is long; over 60 pages. The
  source for this PDF is is `sheaves.lyx`. It can be edited with the LyX
  typesetting application.

* The [connectors-and-variables.pdf](connectors-and-variables.pdf) file.
  It is complementary to the above, repeating some material. It is meant to
  provide a more detailed footing. To avoid a snowball of ever-increasing
  length, it is split into bite-sized chapters. The chapters are currently,
  in serial order:

    * [mereology.pdf](mereology.pdf) discusses the relationship of the
   connector-and-sheaf viewpoint to the philosophical notions of mereology
   and postmodernism.

    * [tensors.pdf](tensors.pdf) defines a generalized tensor as an algebraic
   object. It is meant to formalize earlier statements, while still being
   readable and approachable.

    * [learning.pdf](learning.pdf) examines what happens if one takes
   conventional querying or pattern-matching, and replaces it with a
   connectionist approach. The result is a natural generalization of
   querying, which can be appropriately termed "learning".

    * [sheaf-axioms.pdf](sheaf-axioms.pdf) formally defines what a topology
   is, and what a (pre-)sheaf is, and demonstrates how the jigsaw-puzzle
   piece analogy formally meets the criteria for these mathematical
   objects.

    * [ram-cpu.pdf](ram-cpu.pdf) gives a precise mathematical definition for
   a graph, a hypergraph and a metagraph, and, very importantly, explains
   how metagraphs are more efficient, more flexible and more powerful for
   storing graphs, than graph databases are. The representational
   differences are minor, but the side effects are major. This is a
   pre-req for understanding sheaf stores.

* The [factorization.pdf](factorization.pdf) file (under construction)
  attempts to provide a mathematical foundation for the use of grammar
  and syntax in the extraction of structure in high-dimensional
  probability theory. (under construction, recently started, not
  finished.)

* The [ccg.pdf](ccg.pdf) file demonstrates that Combinatorial Categorial
  Grammars (CCG) are equivalent to Link Grammars (LG). This also
  provides a practical example of how connector sexuality can be used to
  resolve real-world interpretational problems in computational
  linguistics. The most interesting question it poses is about the
  relationship between connector sexuality and type constructors.
