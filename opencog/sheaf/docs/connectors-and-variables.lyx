\end_layout

\begin_layout Abstract
Almost all classical work on logic and symbolic reasoning, and indeed, much
 of mathematics, including lambda calculus and term algebras, are built
 on the intuitive foundation of 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

variables
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

functions
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 that map between them.
 Modern work on linguistics and category theory indicates an alternative
 viewpoint: that of 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

connectors
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
 In this view, the act of replacing a variable by a value, and 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

plugging it into a function
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 (beta-reduction) is a special case of connecting a pair of connectors.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Abstract
This is a short note clarifying the relationship between these two concepts.
 Noteworthy is that the concept of connectors is 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

more general
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, and that, as a mathematical framework, it is far less explored.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Abstract
As a footnote, it is noted that the use of connectors (and the implied sheaf
 theory) appears to have impact on a number of philosophical arguments,
 ranging from mereology to postmodernism(!) This is a surprise.
 (The author acknowledges that it sounds perhaps cranky to place such claims
 in the abstract, but the notions are heart-felt.)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section*
Introduction
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In elementary mathematics, it is commonplace to speak of a variable, such
 as 
\begin_inset Formula $x$
\end_inset

, and functions of that variable, such as 
\begin_inset Formula $f(x)$
\end_inset

.
 The power of this abstraction is that variables can be assigned a value,
 and that value can be 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

plugged into
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 a function.
 For example, one asserts that 
\begin_inset Formula $x=42$
\end_inset

 and then ponders 
\begin_inset Formula $f(42)$
\end_inset

.
 This act of 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

plugging in
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 is formally called 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

beta reduction
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This process of 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

plugging in
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 can be compared to the process of 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

connecting
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, for example, connecting together two jigsaw-puzzle pieces.
 When mating together connectors, one typically has a matched pair that
 can be mated: a plug that can be plugged into a socket.
 It should be clear that beta reduction is a special case of this: that
 
\begin_inset Formula $f(x)$
\end_inset

 is a 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

socket
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 into which values can be plugged into.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This observation seems nearly trivial; it is so painfully obvious that one
 wonders what more can be said.
 Yet there are tremendous consequences that arise from this, consequences
 that are in some sense equally trivial and obvious.
 That something is 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

obvious
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 is perhaps an indicator that it is important.
 This note dwells on these 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

obvious
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 ideas, and demonstrates their importance.
 The problem with 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

obviousness
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 is that it frames all manner of thinking: it is Aristotle's 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

formal cause
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, applied to thinking.
 It is provides a normative framework in which all conversation takes place.
 Design and thinking happen in the foreground; there is a 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

figure
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

ground
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, and anything that is obvious falls into the background, becomes implicit,
 and serves as a barrier to further thought and examination.
 Thus, the impetus for this note.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The starting point of this note is that, when one thinks of variables and
 functions, one is inevitably lead to the notion of 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

directed acyclic graphs
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 (DAGs).
 That is, plugging variables into functions, and those into other functions
 invariably leads to a DAG, because the sense of direction of 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

plugging in
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 must be preserved: one cannot plug a variable into a value; one cannot
 plug a function into a value; the plugging is always directed.
 One is a receptacle, the other is not.
 By contrast, that act of connecting together connectors has no such constraint:
 a jigsaw puzzle is not a DAG; there is no jigsaw piece 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

at the top
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, and none 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

at the bottom
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
 Although the connectors in a jigsaw puzzle have a polarity, the sense of
 direction that they offer is immaterial to the final construction.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The desired conclusion is that by approaching knowledge representation as
 an assemblage of connections, rather than as a unidirectional network of
 inferences, one can gain considerable power in working with the common
 problems and stumbling blocks of AI and AGI, including problems of planning,
 inference, constraint satisfaction, combinatorial explosion and the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

frame problem
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This note begins with a long review of everywhere that the notion of variables
 and functions appear, or, more generally, of arrows and directed graphs.
 This may seem pointless, but serves only to underscore their ubiquity.
 This is followed by a section that develops the proposed alternative.
 Along the way, assorted commentary is made with regards to outstanding
 philosophical problems, as befits any exploration that belabors the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

obvious
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section*
Arrows
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Arrows, and usually accompanying DAGs are everywhere.
 They really are pervasive in descriptions of mathematics, in symbolic AI
 and knowledge representation, and even underpin vast tracts of philosophy.
 This is, again, so potently 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

obvious
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 that an explicit review is called for.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection*
In philosophy:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Here's a hint of how pervasively important the concept of variables and
 values can be.
 Some philosophers use these notions to anchor the idea of 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

objects
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 or 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

things
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 that 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

exist
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

An object is anything that can be the value of a variable, that is, anything
 we can talk about using pronouns, that is, anything.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 (Van Inwagen 2002, 180)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This conception of an object then leads to confused discussions about the
 identity of indiscernibles, and the importance of location (space-time)
 in mereology.
 The notion of connectors can be used as an alternate foundation for the
 conception of 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

objects
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

identity
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

location
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
 Specifically, one can instead define objects as 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

things that can participate in relationships
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection*
In term algebra:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The theory of term algebras is a specific branch of mathematics that deals
 with the abstract process of performing generic algebraic manipulations,
 as any mathematician or engineer might do when working with pencil and
 paper.
 It is important for the theory of computation, because much what we do
 with computers is to manipulate symbols; term algebras provide a coherent
 vocabulary of ideas for thinking about algorithms that manipulate symbols.
 This is, in turn, important for both logic, and for symbolic AI, since
 reasoning engines and algorithmic theorem provers are built on such symbolic
 manipulations.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Consider a typical definition of a term algebra.
 It consists of:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
A set of constants 
\begin_inset Formula $c_{0},c_{1},\cdots$
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
A set of variables 
\begin_inset Formula $x,y,z,\cdots$
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
A set of 
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset

-ary function symbols 
\begin_inset Formula $f\left(x_{1},\cdots,x_{n}\right)$
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The terms of a term algebra are then anything that can be constructed from
 the above, by recursively 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

plugging in
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
 That the resulting terms always have the structure of a DAG should be intuitive
ly obvious.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In type theory, it is common to assign types to the different constants,
 variables and function symbols; this does not alter the result that the
 terms are DAGs.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection*
In set theory:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In (well-founded) (naive) set theory, there is effectively just one function
 symbol: the set, and only one constant: the empty set.
 There are no variables, in the sense that proper sets do not contain variables
 in them.
 Of course, in the definition of the axioms (and axiom schemas!) that define
 set theory, and in the articulation of the theory itself, it is impossible
 to avoid variables; its just that variables are not set elements.
 By definition, 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

well-foundedness
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 disallows infinitely recursive sets.
 Thus, effectively, all finite sets in set theory have the shape of a DAG
 (they form a partial order).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection*
In computer science:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Lambda calculus can be thought of as having arbitrary constants and variables,
 but only one function symbol: the lambda.
 It is effectively a theory of linear strings (sequences) of symbols arranged
 in order, on a line.
 Insofar as lambda expressions can be beta-reduced, they form a DAG.
 Lambda calculus is manifestly finite: it is very unusual to study countable
 or uncountable limits of lambda calculus.
 In general, lambda calculus is always assumed to be well-founded, so that
 the expressions are always DAGs.
 An exception to this is chem-lambda (Buliga 2003), which redefines lambda
 as having input and output connectors, thus allowing looping connections
 to be made.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The general typed lambda calculus famously corresponds to computer programs,
 this is the Curry-Howard correspondence.
 Infinite loops can be thought of in two ways in computing.
 One way is as a directed graph containing a loop: the arrows denote a function
 that recursively calls back to itself.
 The state transitions are described by points (for states) and arrows (denoting
 state transitions), arranged such that one (or more!) collections of arrows
 can be traced in a circular loop.
 The other way of thinking of infinite loops is as recursive structures:
 one unrolls the loop so that it becomes an infinitely-long unterminating
 sequence of arrows.
 Roughly speaking, infinite loops correspond to ill-founded sets.
 They are the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

gunk
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 of philosophy.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The moral of the story that is being presented here is that almost all of
 computer science is founded on a theory of DAGs.
 Even when loops are allowed, the graphs are formed from edges that are
 directed: the edges are always arrows.
 This is not the same as a general theory of connectors connecting things
 together.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection*
In topology:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The infinite binary tree provides a simple example of unrolling a pair of
 interconnected loops.
 Axiomatically, a binary tree is constructed from a pair of left-right elements,
 and each element can be another pair, or the termination symbol.
 In this sense, both the left and right elements can loop back onto themselves;
 when the loops are unrolled, the tree becomes infinite DAG (rather than
 a small graph containing a pair of loops).
 The endpoints of a binary tree form the Cantor set; there are an uncountable
 infinity of them.
 These are the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

points
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 of point-set topology.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
One can also have a point-free topology, built on top of lattice theory.
 Rather than considering points as mereological simples, one instead focuses
 on the directedness of set inclusion.
 Starting with the notion of a partially-ordered set, the axioms of lattice
 theory allow one to concentrate on meets and joins, filters and ideals,
 frames and locales, without once bringing up the notion of a point.
 Yet, in the end, partial orders are founded on the idea of direction, of
 inclusion, with set theoretic notions of the same providing much of the
 intuitive grounding.
 There is a DAG, even if discussion of terminal elements is avoided.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection*
In category theory:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The simply typed lambda calculus is important, as it is the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

internal language
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 of 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Cartesian closed categories
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
 The Cartesian-closed categories naturally describe 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

tuples
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 of 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

things
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

: that is, things that can be placed in an ordered list (a 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Cartesian product
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

).
 The 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

things
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 are presumed to be discernible items
\begin_inset Foot
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout
One could say 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

objects
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 instead of 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

items
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, as that is the appropriate term for category theory.
 It is, however, useful in the present case to use the slightly more vague
 term 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

items
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\end_inset

 that have an identity.
 Indiscernibles are not described by Cartesian closed categories; for this,
 needs symmetric monoidal categories.
 Tensors and tensor algebras, vector spaces and Hilbert spaces famously
 belong to this category; the internal language is 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

linear logic
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
 Yet, the tensor category is dagger-compact: it has a left-right symmetry
 to it that constrains structure.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A pending critique of neural nets is that they are founded on vector spaces
 (and thus are part of the tensor category, which is symmetric) whereas
 natural language is described by monoidal categories that are manifestly
 not symmetric.
 This observation has been pursued elsewhere, in various writings by this
 author.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Category theory itself is a theory of dots and arrows.
 Every dot has an arrow back to itself (thus, a loop), and arrows can be
 composed: if there is a sequence of two arrows connecting three dots, then
 there always is an arrow, going in the same sense, between the two endpoints.
 This is all that a category is.
 Deep theorems follow, such as the existence of all limits, given only spans
 and equalizers! Category theory is surprising in it's power.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The moral of the story that is being presented here is that almost all of
 computer science is founded on a theory of DAGs.
 Even when loops are allowed, the graphs are formed from edges that are
 directed: the edges are always arrows.
 This is not the same as a general theory of connectors connecting things
 together.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection*
In model theory:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Model theory takes the idea of a term algebra, and supplements it with relations.
 Relations are 
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset

-ary predicates 
\begin_inset Formula $P\left(t_{1},\cdots,t_{n}\right)$
\end_inset

 of terms 
\begin_inset Formula $t_{k}$
\end_inset

 from the term algebra.
 A predicate is either true, or it is false: it either holds or does not.
 The most famous predicate is that of equality; the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

theory of pure equality
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 is a term algebra supplemented with a predicate defining equality.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Predicates are useless unless they can be combined using the operators of
 logic: 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

and
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

or
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

not
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

there exists
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

for all
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
 Curiously enough, the rules for combining these operators again form a
 DAG: the sigma-pi hierarchy.
 Combining terms with predicates seems nearly enough to serve as a foundation
 for all mathematics.
 The sigma-pi hierarchy, taken on set theory, is extremely powerful.
 Just the first few levels: first-order logic and second-order logic are
 enough to meet the concerns of most classical mathematics.
 Even things that are 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

larger
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 than set theory can be represented in this hierarchy: this is the content
 of the Yoneda lemma.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The moral of the story is as before: when viewed from the meta-perspective,
 DAGs appear to be sufficient to describe all of mathematics.
 It is hardly a surprise that they are part of the ground, the background,
 and not a part of the figure.
 They are a part of the under-pinnings of the meta-mathematics, and are
 almost never overtly discussed.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection*
In relational algebras:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Removing the term algebra but keeping the relations results in a 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

relational algebra
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, with examples of relations being 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

is-a
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

has-a
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

part-of
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
 Limiting oneself to a single part-whole relationship, one arrives at mereology
 as a possible alternative to set theory as a foundation for mathematics.
 But one also arrives the the notion of 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

gunk
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 in philosophy (that, roughly speaking, infinite recursion is possible,
 when considering the structure of physical reality), as well as a number
 of puzzles dating to Ancient Greece (the Ship of Theseus: what happens
 when parts are replaced? The Statue and the Lump of Clay: what happens
 when parts are rearranged?).
 That there are such puzzles is perhaps endemic to the desire to apply part-whol
e relationships, and the adduced DAG partial orders as a fundamental ground
 on which to build philosophical discussions.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection*
In knowledge representation:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A practical application of relational algebras can be found in the field
 of knowledge representation.
 Practical systems embodying relational algebras include key-value databases
 and SQL databases.
 The 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

key
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 is a named slot, the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

value
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 is the item that is attached to the key (that occupies the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

slot
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 named by the key).
 Hierarchical relations can be built by placing keys into slots: thus, for
 example, the Unix file-system is effectively a key-value database.
 On the surface, SQL databases seem to be quite different, having a tabular
 structure, consisting of a fixed schema (a fixed 
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset

-ary predicate), the instances of which are rows in a table.
 Yet it is famously the case that SQL and key-value databases are categorial
 opposites to one-another: if one takes the arrow relationships in one,
 and reverses the sense of the arrows, one obtains the other (Meyer 2011).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Actual data-sets occurring in knowledge representation include WordNet,
 which provides synonym, holonym and meronym relations.
 The urge to solve the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

grounding problem
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 leads to 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

upper ontologies
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, such as SUMO, which asserts that things are objects, and classifies types
 of things.
 Ontologies themselves force the user to make distinctions between intensional
 and extensional membership, intensional and extensional inheritance.
 For example, one can assert that dogs are a kind of animal (intensional)
 and then assert that 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Fluffy
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 is an example of a dog (extensional - belongs to the class of dogs).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Ontologies provide only a handful of such relationships (is-a, has-a, part-of).
 To generalize to a greater number of relations, one arrives at the notion
 of 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

semantic triples
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

: these are effectively labeled arrows: the two endpoints (head and tail)
 of the arrow, and a label for the relationship type.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As before, the presence of arrows implies ordering relationships, with concomita
nt notions of transitivity, (anti-)reflexivity, (anti-)symmetry, even when
 they may be a good bit more fuzzy and vague, as in the domain of 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

common sense
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
 As Spock might say, human gut feels are not logical.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section*
Graphs
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Unlike the examples above, graph theory offers a different possibility:
 the undirected edge.
 Unfortunately, this is again 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

painfully obvious
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, and we'll have to slog through a lot of rather obvious observations to
 make anything resembling progress.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The canonical definition of a graph is that of two sets: a set 
\begin_inset Formula $V$
\end_inset

 of vertices and a set 
\begin_inset Formula $E$
\end_inset

 of edges.
 An edge 
\begin_inset Formula $e_{k}\in E$
\end_inset

 is a pair 
\begin_inset Formula $e_{k}=\left\{ v_{i},v_{j}\right\} $
\end_inset

 of vertices, with each 
\begin_inset Formula $v_{i}\in V$
\end_inset

.
 Although this definition is adequate for most mathematical applications,
 it is severely deficient for algorithmic applications.
 The biggest issue is that of non-locality of data.
 If one merely stuffs the vertices and edges into a table, then a graph
 walk in general appears to look like a uniformly distributed random hop
 through those tables: terrible for modern computers which rely on locality,
 so that caches can speed data access performance.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This section develops an alternative representation for graphs, and argues

 It addresses not only some of the practical problems in the DAG-view of

\begin_layout Standard
The problem of locality can be (partly) solved by defining graphs in a different
 way: in terms of vertexes, and the (half-)edges that attach to each vertex.
 In this case, one creates a table of pairs 
\begin_inset Formula $\left(v_{i},\left\{ e_{i1},e_{i2},\cdots,e_{ik}\right\} \right)$
\end_inset

 of a vertex 
\begin_inset Formula $v_{i}$
\end_inset

 and the set of all edges landing on that vertex.
 It is convenient to think of the edges as 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

half-edges
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, as it is enough to identify the remote end to which they connect; the
 local end is implicit: it is just the vertex 
\begin_inset Formula $v_{i}$
\end_inset

 at the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

center
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
 As this is obvious, it can be belabored with a diagram.

The black dot represents the vertex; the open circles represent the unconnected
 half-edges.
 As this vaguely resembles a burr, this general shape will be referred to
 as a

\begin_inset Quotes erd

\begin_inset Quotes erd

 in what follows.
 Connecting these proceeds in the

The unconnected dots, the half-edges, can be called connectors, in which
 the jigsaw-puzzle piece analogy comes into full force.
 Another

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The explicit polarity of the mating, despite the fact that the resulting
 edge is an undirected edge, serves several purposes.
 Foremost, it helps avoid mating errors: if the connectors do not have opposite
 polarity, they cannot attach.
 Secondly, they can be used to establish directionality, when that is needed.
 As the previous section noted, directed edges are everywhere; this did
 not mean to imply that they are useless! The collection of tabs and sockets
 can come in a large variety of shapes.
 These shapes correspond to the

 Most importantly, the concept of vertices adorned with connectors allows
 one to define a concept of a grammar.

\begin_layout Standard
The burrs/seeds/puzzle-pieces, as presented above, are obviously 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

compositional
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, in that there is an obvious way to connect them together.
 Once connected, the resulting structure is again of the same form: some
 network of vertices connected with edges, and some unconnected half-edges
 sticking out of it.
 Furthermore, it should be clear that the order in which pieces are assembled
 is immaterial: one obtains the same figure, no matter what the sequence.

AtomSpace
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The AtomSpace is a graph database intended to provide generic support for
 knowledge representation, logical inference, and symbolic AI reasoning.
 It provides a large variety of operators for constructing terms and defining
 relations, as well as a fairly comprehensive type system for assigning
 types to variables and working with signatures of functions and terms.
 In this sense, it incorporates many features that are commonly accepted
 in quotidian computer science.
 There is some question about how the existing AtomSpace implementation
 should inter-operate with the idea of connectors and bonds.
 The goal of this section is to review the existing type system, and how
 it can interface with a connector-and-bond system.

\begin_layout Subsection*
The Atomese Type System
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The existing Atomese type system is an extensible system of types usually
 defined at compile time.
 Although new types can be added at run-time, it is usually useful to have
 a corresponding object-oriented class definition for each type, so that
 the types can 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

do things
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 (be evaluatable, perform numeric operations, perform i/o operations, etc.)
 As a result, the type hierarchy is somewhat limited and fairly rigid.
 Although there are more than 100 different types in use in the current
 system, only a handful of these are relevant to the current discussion.
 A quick sketch of these is given below.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The core concept underlying Atomese is the 
\noun on
Atom
\noun default
: a globally-unique immutable structure which can be referenced and can
 be used as an anchor for mutable, varying 
\noun on
Value
\noun default
s.
 All 
\noun on
Atom
\noun default
s derive from two basic types: the 
\noun on
Node
\noun default
 and the 
\noun on
Link
\noun default
.
 The 
\noun on
Node
\noun default
 is simply a (UTF-8) string.
 All 
\noun on
Node
\noun default
s having the same string name are in fact the same 
\noun on
Node
\noun default
.
 Very crudely, one can think of 
\noun on
Node
\noun default
s as named vertexes of a graph.
 The 
\noun on
Link
\noun default
 corresponds to a hyper-edge: a 
\noun on
Link
\noun default
 can contain zero, one, two or more 
\noun on
Atom
\noun default
s; it is a possibly-empty list of 
\noun on
Atom
\noun default
s.
 
\noun on
Link
\noun default
s to not have any other properties; in particular, they have no string name.
 Thus, crudely, one may think of a 
\noun on
Link
\noun default
 containing exactly two 
\noun on
Node
\noun default
s as an ordinary graph edge.
 Like 
\noun on
Node
\noun default
s, 
\noun on
Link
\noun default
s are globally unique: there can only ever be one 
\noun on
Link
\noun default
 containing a given list of 
\noun on
Atom
\noun default
s.
 It is very convenient to think of a 
\noun on
Link
\noun default
 as a vertex internal to a tree; the 
\noun on
Node
\noun default
s are the leafs of the tree.
 The trees are necessarily acyclic, and finite; it is not possible to construct
 a 
\noun on
Link
\noun default
 that contains itself.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The AtomSpace is a container for 
\noun on
Atom
\noun default
s.
 As each 
\noun on
Atom
\noun default
 is effectively a tree, one can think of it as a forest-of-trees.
 However, since each 
\noun on
Atom
\noun default
 is globally unique (within an AtomSpace), a more accurate conceptual visualizat
ion is that of a rhizome or woolen felt, as different trees typically share
 the same branches.
 In the following, s-expressions will be used to write down trees.

\begin_layout Standard
Declares the name of a variable.

\family default
.
 This states that the the variable is necessarily of type 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

\noun on
Concept
\noun default

\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, with 
\noun on
ConceptNode
\noun default
 being one of the many predefined types in the system.
 The 
\noun on
TypeNode
\noun default
 is just a 
\noun on

\noun default
 whose string name must be the string representation of a simple type.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection*
SignatureLink
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A mechanism to declare or construct a compound or complex type.
 For example,

 constructs a type consisting of two

s, and given a fixed label of

 The specific meaning of 
\noun on
EvaluationLink

 are of no particular concern here, they're merely examples of some of the
