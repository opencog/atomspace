; OVERVIEW
; --------
; The scripts below analyze a sequence of atoms, assigning to them a
; spanning-tree (MST) parse, showing the dependencies between the atoms
; in the sequence. The result of this parse is then used to create
; disjuncts, summarizing how the atoms in the sequence are allowed to
; connect.
;
; Input is sequence of atoms, together with a scoring function for
; ordered pairs of atoms. In the typical usage, the scoring function
; will return the mutual information between a pair of atoms, and
; so the MST parse is the tree-parse that maximizes the mutual
; infomration between pairs of atoms.
;
; The algorithm implemented is a basic maximum spanning tree algorithm.
; Conceptually, the graph to be spanned by the tree is a clique, with
; with every atom in the sequence being connected to every other atom.
; The edge-lengths are given by the score betweeen atoms.
;
; The spanning tree is then computed. Finally, disjuncts are created
; from the resulting parse, by looking at how each atom is attached to
; the other atoms.

  Maximum Spanning Tree parser.

  Given a sequence of atoms, find an (unlabelled) dependency parse
  of the sequence, by finding a dependency tree that maximizes the
  pair-wise scoring function. This returns a list of atom-pairs,
  together with associated score.

  The ATOM-LIST should be a scheme-list of atoms, all presumably of
  a uniform atom type.

  The SCORE-FN should be a function that, when give a left-right ordered
  pair of atoms, and the distance between them, returns a numeric score
  for that pair. This numeric score will be maximized during the parse.
  The most basic choice is to use the mutual information between the
  pair of atoms.  The SCORE-FN should take three arguments: left-atom,
  right-atom and (numeric) distance.

  The M in MST normally stands for 'minimum', but this code maximizes.

  There are many MST algorithms; the choice was made as follows:
  Prim is very easy; but seems too simple to give good results.
  Kruskal is good, but seems hard to control a no-link-cross constraint. (?)
  This implements a variant of Borůvka's algo, which seems to be robust,
  and fast enough for the current needs.

  The no-links-cross constraint might not be required, see
  R. Ferrer-i-Cancho (2006) “Why do syntactic links not cross?”
  However, that would require changing the metric from mutual information
  to something else, perhaps incorporating the dependency distance
  (as defined by Ferrer-i-Cancho), or possibly the 'hubiness', or some
  combination.  Since I really, really want to stick to entropy concepts,
  the mean-dependency-distance metric needs to be re-phrased as some
  sort of graph entropy. Hmmm...

  Another idea is to apply the Dick Hudson Word Grammar landmark
  transitivity idea, but exactly how this could work for unlabelled
  trees has not been explored.

  So, for now, a no-links-cross constraint is handed-coded into the algo.
  Without it, it seems that the pair-MI scores alone give rather unruly
  dependencies (unclear, needs exploration).  So, in the long-run, it
  might be better to instead pick something that combines MI scores with
  mean-dependency-distance or with hubbiness. See, for example:
  Haitao Liu (2008) “Dependency distance as a metric of language
  comprehension difficulty” Journal of Cognitive Science, 2008 9(2): 159-191.
  or also:
  Ramon Ferrer-i-Cancho (2013) “Hubiness, length, crossings and their
  relationships in dependency trees”, ArXiv 1304.4086
