"""
Example of creating a "behavior tree" in the AtomSpace.

Behavior trees can be thought of as long sequences of nested
if-then-else statements; the branch that is taken results in
a "behavior" being performed.

Behavor trees are usually driven by dynamic data; however, to keep
the example simple, the below is static; it simply counts green and
red lights, and halts at the first red light.

The if-then is implemented via a matching clause with the pattern
matcher. When a match is seen, the matcher moves on to the next
clause.
