; deduction-engine.scm -- Very simple goal solving using Get/PutLinks.
;
; The point of this example is to show how ProLog-like deductions can
; be made, and, more precisely, how to write a ProLog-like chainer
; in Atomese. That is, one can implement ProLog in Atomese, and the
; goal of this example is to show how to do that.
;
;; XXX under construction, incomplete.
;
; Critiques:
; Aside from being unfinished, this example also avoids using the
; rule engine, and instead, attempts to create it's own home-grown
; rule engine.
;
; This example also avoids the use of the OpenPsi engine. The OpenPsi
; engine is useful for organizing multiple conflicting rules into
; classes, and prioritizing the rule selection and application based
; on those rule classes.  Thus, it allows complex deductive chains to
; be managed in an economic fashion, avoiding some of the combinatorial
; explosion associated with backward/forward chaining.

;;; A named satisfiability query: Does Bill like $X?
;;; The EvaluationLink just asserts that "Bill does like X" (as a fact).
;;; The SatisfactionLink turns it into a question: the SatisfactionLink
;;; can evaluate to true or false, depending on what X is.
;;; Note that the SatisfactionLink is in the form of a lambda; that is,
;;; it has the form  λX.(Bill likes X)
;;;
;;; Finally, we want to give the above a name, so that we can refer to it
;;; in other places. We use the DefineLink to do this. Given a lambda,
;;; for example, λx.(stuff) which is just an anonymous function taking x,
;;; the DefineLink turns it into a named function: so that 
;;;    Define name λx.(stuff)
;;; is the same as 
;;;    (name x).(stuff)
;;;
;;; So, below, the DefineLink merely gives the question a name: It just
;;; says that there is a particular question, which is given the name 
;;; "Does Bill like X?", and that this question takes a single variable
;;; i.e $X.  We infer this variable from the SatisfactionLink.  That is,
;;; the DefineLink binds exactly the same variables that the lambda under
;;; it does (with SatisfactionLink being the lambda).
