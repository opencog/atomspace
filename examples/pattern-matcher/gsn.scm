; GroundedShemaNode Demo.
;
; After a pattern-match has been found, arbitrary code can be
; triggered to run.  This demo shows how.
;
; Running arbitary functions upon match can be useful for any number
; of reasons:  to send a message whenever a match is found; to perform
; some particularly complex or odious computation, and so on.
;
; The run this, you probably need to do this:
;
; OCDIR=home/home/yourname/opencog
; export LTDL_LIBRARY_PATH=$OCDIR/build/opencog/guile:$OCDIR/build/opencog/query
;
; Add the following to your ~/.guile file:
; (add-to-load-path "/home/yourname/opencog/build")
; (add-to-load-path "/home/yourname/opencog/opencog/scm")
; (add-to-load-path ".")
;
; Start guile:
; guile
;
; and then load this file:
; (load-from-path "gsn.scm")
;
; Then, scroll to the bottom, and some of the commented-out
; examples.

;; Some arbitrary function, taking one atom as an argument.
;; This function could take zero, two or more arguments; however,
;; in general, it should always return an atom.  It doesn't have to;
;; if it returns something else, then that will e discarded and
;; replaced by the invalid atom.

	(display "Hello, ")
	(display (cog-name atom))

;; Executing the below will cause the "say-hello" function to be called,
;; with the list of atoms in the ListLink being the arguments to the
;; function. To execute, do this:
;;
;;    (cog-execute! say-hello-to-linas)
;;
;; The number of atoms in the ListLink should correspond to the number
;; of arguments of the called function. Failure for the two to
;; correspond will generally result in a hang or crash.

;;
;; To demonstrate this, we need to populate the atomspace with some data.
;; In this case, some assertions about who is human.
