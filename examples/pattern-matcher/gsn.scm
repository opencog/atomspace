;
; After a pattern-match has been found, arbitrary code can be
; triggered to run.  This demo shows how.
;
; Running arbitrary functions upon match can be useful for any number
; of reasons:  to send a message whenever a match is found; to perform
; some particularly complex or odious computation, and so on.

(use-modules (opencog) (opencog query))

;; Some arbitrary function, taking one atom as an argument.
;; This function could take zero, two or more arguments; however,
;; in general, it should always return an atom.  It doesn't have to;
;; if it returns something else, then that will e discarded and
;; replaced by the invalid atom.
(define (say-hello atom)
	(display "Hello, ")
	(display (cog-name atom))
	(display "!")
	(newline)
	atom
)

;; Executing the below will cause the "say-hello" function to be called,
;; with the list of atoms in the ListLink being the arguments to the
;; function. To execute, do this:
;;
;;    (cog-execute! say-hello-to-linas)
;;
;; The number of atoms in the ListLink should correspond to the number
;; of arguments of the called function. Failure for the two to
;; correspond will generally result in a hang or crash.
(define say-hello-to-linas

;; ExecutionOutputLinks are particularly useful when combined with the
;; pattern matcher. They can be used to invoke a function every time
;; that a match is found.
;;
;; To demonstrate this, we need to populate the AtomSpace with some data.
;; In this case, some assertions about who is human.
