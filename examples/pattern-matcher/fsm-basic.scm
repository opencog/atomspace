; fsm-basic.scm -- Very Simple Finite State Machine (FSM) Demo.
;
; This defines a very simple four-state finite state machine: an initial
; state, and a cycle of three state: green, yellow, red. It then uses a
; BindLink to take one step at a time.  The BindLink is more or less
; "universal", in that it can run any FSM, not  just this one. However,
; here it has been a bit simplified, to keep the demo as simple as
; possible. See the file `fsm-full.scm` for the correct way to define a
; truly general-purpose FSM, in such a way that multiple FSM's can be run
; at the same time.

;;; Take one step of a finite state machine.

;;; rules.
;;;
;;; To define two or more machines that run at the same time, each
;;; should use a different AnchorNode, so that the states of the
;;; various machines would not get confused with one-another.
;;; It would also probably be a good idea to include the machine name
;;; (i.e. the AnchorNode) as part of the transition rules, so that
;;; the transition rules for one machine would not get used accidentally
;;; for another machine.
