;; Four different ways to check for the existence of some structure
;; in the AtomSpace.
;;
;; Each variant checks to see if the AtomSpace contains the link
;;    (ListLink (AnchorNode "Room State") (ConceptNode "room empty"))
;;
;; If the AtomSpace does contain the above, then the print-msg function
;; is run. Each different method has its strengths and weaknesses.
;; Several of the methods are good for designing behavior trees that
;; run inside the AtomSpace.  Others fit the more traditional query
;; paradigm.

;; that variable.
;;
;; This variant has an advantage over the next one, as it requires
;; only one invocation of the pattern matcher, not two. Because it
;; uses the SequentialAndLink, it is in a form appropriate for creating
;; a behavior tree.
;;
;; Note that there may be other atoms linked to the Anchor;
;; it there are, then those other atoms are ignored. This may be
;; an advantage or a disadvantage; the next example demands that
;; there be only one atom linked to the Anchor.

;; This variant uses a GetLink to fetch the room-state from the
;; AtomSpace, and then uses EqualLink to see if it is in the desired
;; state. Note that this results in *two* invocations of the pattern
;; matcher; the GetLink being the inner one.  Note also that the
;; GetLink returns it's results in a SetLink, so comparison must
;; use a SetLink as well.
;;
;; In this example, the variable $x is bound by the GetLink, and
;; is thus not available outside of the GetLink.  Thus, the grounding
;; for that variable cannot be given to the print-message routine.
;;
;; Unlike the previous example, this one will explicitly fail if there
;; are other atoms linked to the Anchor.  That is, the equality
;; check is making sure that the SetLink has one and only one element
;; in it, which effectively blocks other anchored atoms.  This may be
;; an advantage, or a disadvantage, depending on the situation.

;;    of ordered execution.
;; -- The action to be performed must be in the form of a GSN, and thus
;;    it must return an atom, not a truth value.
;; -- Because of the above, actions cannot be chained: this is not
