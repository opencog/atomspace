;; Four different ways to check for the existance of some structure
;; in the atomspace.
;;
;; Each variant checks to see if the atomspace contains the link
;;    (ListLink (AnchorNode "Room State") (ConceptNode "room empty"))
;;
;; If the atomspace does contain the above, then the print-msg function
;; is run. Each different method has its strengths and weaknesses.
;; Several of the methods are good for designing behavior trees that
;; run inside the AtomSpace.  Others fit the more traditional query
;; paradigm.
