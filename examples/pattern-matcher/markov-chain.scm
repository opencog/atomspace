; Probabilistic Finite State Machine (Markov Chain) Demo.
;
; Based on fsm-full.scm, this defines a very simple four-state Markov
; chain, using the same states as the demo FSM's. The difference here is
; that the transitions are specified probabilistically; mutiple
; transitions may occur; each transition has a fixed probability.
;
; Another way to look at this is an example of matrix multiplication.
; The state of a Markov chain is a vector, and the state transtions
; can be understood as a matrix (a Markov matrix, where the columns
; sum to one).  One iteration of the probabilistic state machine
; corresponds to one matrix multiplication.
;
; In either viewpoint, the numbers, which are probabilities, are
; stored in the "strength" portion of a SimpleTruthValue.
;
; The run this, you probably need to do this:
;
; OCDIR=home/home/yourname/opencog
; export LTDL_LIBRARY_PATH=$OCDIR/build/opencog/guile:$OCDIR/build/opencog/query
;
; Add the following to your ~/.guile file:
; (add-to-load-path "/home/yourname/opencog/build")
; (add-to-load-path "/home/yourname/opencog/opencog/scm")
; (add-to-load-path ".")
;
; Start guile:
; guile
;
; and then load this file:
; (load-from-path "markov-chain.scm")
;
; Then, scroll to the bottom, and some of the commented-out
; examples.

;; Each rule is labelled with the "my-fsm", so that rules for

;; usually used to  express conditional probabilities, so that

;; of the machine, and B the the next state of theh machine, so that P(B|A)
;; is the probability of transitioning to state B give that the machine is
;; in state A.  Such a system is called a Markov Chain.
