; fsm-mealy.scm -- Mealy Finite State Machine (FSM) Demo.
;
; Based on fsm-full.scm, this alters the general FSM definition to
; include a dependency on the external state.
;
; To run this demo, load this file:

; (load-from-path "fsm-mealy.scm")
;
; Then, scroll to the bottom, and try some of the commented-out examples.
