; fsm-full.scm -- Finite State Machine (FSM) Demo.
;
; Based on `fsm-basic.scm`, this defines a very simple four-state finite
; state machine, but illustrates the general (universal) FSM state
; machine constructor.  This allows multiple FSM's to be simultaneously
; defined and operated asynchronously from each-other.

;; not used anywhere in the demo below.

;; The set of allowed state transitions.  Its a triangular cycle,
;; of green going to yellow going to red going back to green.
;; The initial state transitions into green (and is never visited again).
;;
;; Each rule is labelled with the "my-trans", so that rules for
;; different FSM's do not clash with one-another.  A ContextLink is used
;; because that will allow this example to generalize: Context's are
;; usually used to  express conditional probabilities, so that 
;;
;;     Context  <TV>
;;         A
;;         B
;;
;; represents the probability of B conditioned on A, and the TV holds
;; the numeric value for P(B|A).  In this case, A is the current state
;; of the machine, and B the the next state of the machine, so that P(B|A)
;; is the probability of transitioning to state B give that the machine is
;; in state A.  Such a system is called a Markov Chain.
;; 
;; For the example below, P(B|A) is always one.
