; During pattern matching, it can sometimes be useful to call a
; special-purpose function to decide if a given grounding is correct
; or not.  This can be done using the GroundedPredicateNode, as shown
; in this demo.

; Define a function that takes an atom and returns an OpenCog truth
; value. In this case, it randomly returns true or false, about half the
; time.  The function can take zero, two or more arguments, but it must
; always return an opencog truth value, as the truth value will be used
; during pattern matching to make a grounding decision.
(define (rand-ok atom)
	(define r (random 2))
	(simple-format #t "Random number: ~A " r)
	(if (< 0 r)

			(simple-format #t "Picked ~A\n" (cog-name atom))
			(stv 1 1) ; return true
		)
		(begin

			(stv 0 1) ; return false

; The function can be invoked directly, using the cog-evaluate!
; function. The below defines an Evaluation that, when evaluated,
; sometimes picks something, and sometimes doesn't.
