# Demo chemistry atom types.
#
# This file is quite complex. It has six major sections:
# -- Setup CMake to find everything it needs.
# -- Generate the c++, scheme and python wrappers from the
#    master type defintion file.
# -- Build the C++ library holding the needed machinery.
# -- Build a guile scheme module.
# -- Build a python module.
# -- Install all of the above into the root filesystem.
#
# --------------------------------------------------------------
# Part Zero: Set up CMake
# You might also want to make a copy of the CMakefile at the
# root of this project, and edit it down to suit your needs.

# Part One: Build the various language wrappers.

# The `chem_types.script` file defines the types; the other three
# file are c++ files that are autogenerated in the build directory.

# For OCaml, see the `ocaml` subdirectory in the main project.
# Building the OCaml bindings is more complex. Note that, in
# general, OCaml and AtomSpace clash in the notion of a type:
# OCaml wants all types to be compile-time types, whereas the
# the AtomSapce defines them at runtime (and does a lot of
# run-time type-casting). This is at odds to OCaml, and an
# elegant solution to allowing these two systems to co-exist
# has not yet been invented.

# --------------------------------------------------------------
# Part Two: Build the C++ library
#
# The chem_types.h file is written to the build directory

# containing all the needed machinery to make things work.

# it demos an "active" AtomSpace atom.

# Part Three: Build the scheme module
#
# The AtomSpace unit-test infrastructure allows the unit tests
# to be run *before* installing files into the filesystem. The
# price for this is the need for the "config" directives, which
# tell scheme were to find modules in the build directory. This
# mostly just clutters up the text below.
