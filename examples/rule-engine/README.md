Unified Rule Engine examples
============================

Collection of examples using the unified rule engine to demonstrate
forward and backward chaining in OpenCog.

Usage
-----

First, make sure you can run the examples in examples/guile and
examples/pattern-matcher as the rule engine heavily depends on the
pattern matcher. Have a look at examples/guile/README.md and then
examples/pattern-matcher/simple.scm.

Then see `simple/README.md` and `frog/README.md` for a description and
usage of the rule engine examples.
