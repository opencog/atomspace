; get-put.scm -- The two halves of a query.
;
; The BindLink example showed how one can create a query, run it, and
; simultaneously use the query results to create new data in the
; AtomSpace. In fact, this process can be split into two: a "Get"
; part that performs the query, and a "Put" part that performs the
; graph re-writing.
;
; If BindLink is thought of as logical implication:
;	 For all x, P(x) implies Q(x)
; then GetLink is the first half:
;	 For all x, P(x) implies a set {all x that satisfy P(x)}
; while PutLink is the second half:
;	 Create the set {Q(x)} given some other set {x}
; The PutLink is a form of "beta-reduction" or "substitution" or
; "pasting": for each `x` in the set {x} it just pastes `x` into `Q(x)`.
;
; Every BindLink is equivalent to a Get-Put pair. This example
; demonstrates this explicitly.
;
; Splitting a query into a satisfying set, followed by a beta-reduction
; can sometimes allow a more flexible approach to managing the
; knowledgebase. In some sense, Get and Put are opposites: whatever
; one of them does, the other can undo. In this example, a query is
; made for P(x) and then Q(x) is created. But one could, instead,
; create Q(x) first, and then ask for it later. In the language of
; category theory, Get and Put are adjoint functors.
