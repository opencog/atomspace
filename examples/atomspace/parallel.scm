; if you can't run things in parallel. Ah hah! But you can! The
; ParallelLink and the JoinLink allow threads to be created and joined.

; Define three detached threads. When this is evaluated, the
; ParallelLink will create three detached threads, one for each
; Atom in it's outgoing set. (One thread for each SequentialAndLink).
; It will then return immediately to the caller.  Meanwhile, each thread
; will go off and do it's thing. The three threads will each sleep
; a varying amount, and print a message when they are done.
