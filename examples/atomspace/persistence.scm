; persistence.scm -- Putting the AtomSpace into "normal" database.
;
; The AtomSpace is an in-RAM database. You just might want to sometimes
; write some of it out to disk, and save it for later; or maybe you want
; to share AtomSpace contents with other AtomSpaces. This is accomplished
; with "persistance" plug-in modules. As of this writing, there are
; four stable, supported modules for doing this:
;
; (persist-sql)   - Stores the AtomSpace to a PostgreSQL database.
;                   This can be accessed/shared by multiple users,
;                   thus allowing a form of distributed processing.
; (persist-rocks) - Stores the AtomSpace to disk, using RocksDB.
;                   This is several times faster than the Postgres
;                   backend, because it avoids assorted complexities.
; (persist-cog)   - Communicates with another AtomSpace via TCP/IP.
;                   This can be accessed/shared by multiple users,
;                   thus allowing a form of distributed processing.
;                   This is several times faster than the Postgres
;                   backend, because it avoids assorted complexities.
; (persist-file)  - Load and store AtomSpace contents as scheme
;                   s-expressions. This is 10x faster than using the
;                   scheme interpreter to load Atomese data.
;
; This demo illustrates the Postgres backend; the RocksDB and the
; CogServer backend work exactly the same way. You can try them, if
; you've got them installed. The plain-old s-expression subsystem is
; less powerful and less sophisticated; it has a much simpler API,
; and it's own demo.

; Architectural Notes & Commentary.
;
; Before we begin, there is some important background to be aware of.
;
; Besides the modules mentioned above, other SQL, no-SQL and graph
; databases have been tried. This has not worked out so well. It turns
; out that the cost of converting Atoms and Values to the native database
; format (serialization/deserialization) takes up far more CPU time than
; the AtomSpace does. That is, converting Atoms/Values into key-value
; pairs (for no-SQL databases) or into row/column format (for SQL) or
; even into vertexes and edges (for graph databases) is a very costly
; proposition. It take a *lot* of CPU time! Worse, most databases are
; network-enabled, and thus have to create packets, send them and decode
; them at the other end, which adds even more overhead!  We found this
; out the hard way with Neo4J, which ran literally 1000x slower (that's
; right, one-thousand times slower) than what the AtomSpace can do,
; in-RAM. Performance is hard, it turns out.
;
; Another issue is that most databases provide many, many features that
; are simply not needed by the AtomSpace. For example, data analytics
; is more-or-less totally useless. You can store the AtomSpace in a DB,
; but the format defies data analytics, because the AtomSpace format
; encodes language, logic, reasoning, bio-science and other formats that
; are completely opaque to external database systems.
;
; Another issue is that many databases compete for RAM with the
; AtomSpace; since the AtomSpace is an in-RAM database itself, having
; something else competing with it for RAM is wasteful and prevents
; larger datasets from being loadable.
;
; There appear to be three issues to consider when designing apps that
; use the AtomSpace:
;
; (1) Persistence-to-disk. This is best achieved by using the RocksDB
;     module. Its really quite fast, and reasonably compact. It saves
;     the AtomSpace to a file, and you can use ordinary file-management
;     tools to copy distributed and backup RocksDB AtmSpaces. See
;     https://github.com/opencog/atomspace-rocks and the examples there.
;
; (2) Network communications. The best current system for this is the
;     cogserver-based client/server system. A single cogserver can scale
;     to approximately a dozen clients, all sharing data via the common
;     cogserver. This is a single hub-n-spoke model; by running many
;     hubs (many cogservers) one can have a crude distributed AtomSpace
;     system. Of course, two cogservers can talk to one-another in a
;     peer-to-peer fashion. See the repo at
;     https://github.com/opencog/atomspace-cog and the examples there.
;
; (3) Coordination of distributed work. That is, if multiple agents
;     are preforming multiple kinds of processing at various nodes,
;     how should they coordinate, given points (1) and (2) above?
;     This is an area of active research, and no pat answers are
;     currently available.
;
; ----------------------------------------
; This Demo.
;
; This file demos using the generic API to the backend. It explores
; database login, logout and atom loading and storage.  It assumes that
; PostgreSQL has been configured to run with the AtomSpace.
; Unfortunately, this can be quite challenging. Sorry!
; [The instructions are here](../../opencog/persist/sql/README.md)
; Please make sure that the unit tests pass: if you misconfigured
; the database, the unit tests will fail! Caveat Emptor!
;
; This demo can also run, almost unchanged, with the RocksDB backend,
; or the cogserver backend. Some hints below on how to proceed.
;

(use-modules (ice-9 readline))
(activate-readline)

(use-modules (opencog) (opencog persist))

; Lets hop right in. The below should throw an exception, since
; no backend is open yet.
(store-atom (Concept "asdf" (stv 0.42 0.24)))

; For postgres, load the postgres module:
(use-modules (opencog persist-sql))

; For RocksDB, the rocks module. (Won't work, if not installed!)
(use-modules (opencog persist-rocks))

; For the cogserver... (this is also an external component)
(use-modules (opencog persist-cog))

; For postgres, use the test database credentials. These are the
; credentials thatthe unit tests use. Next time the unit tests run,
; they will wipe out this data, and so you should probably create
; and use your own private login.
(define psn (PostgresStorageNode "postgres://opencog_tester:cheese@localhost/opencog_test"))

; The RocksDB requires no configuration. Just use it.
(define rsn (RocksStorageNode "rocks:///tmp/atomspace-rocks-demo"))

; The cogserver requires no configuration. Just use it.
(define csn (CogStorageNode "cog://localhost:17001"))

; Lets use postgres, for now.
(cog-open psn)

; Try storing again.
(store-atom (Concept "asdf" (stv 0.318309886 0.36787944)))

; Close the database.
(cog-close psn)

; Try fetching the atom. The database is closed -- this should fail!
(fetch-atom (Concept "asdf"))

; Reopen the database.
(cog-open psn)

; Try fetching the atom. This time it should work.  Notice that
; it retrieved the correct TruthValue.
(fetch-atom (Concept "asdf"))

; One can save generic Values, as well.
(cog-set-value!
	(Concept "asdf")
	(Predicate "my key")
	(StringValue "Humpty" "Dumpty"))

(store-atom (Concept "asdf"))
(cog-close psn)

; The database is closed. Let's mess with the truth value.
(cog-set-tv! (Concept "asdf") (stv 0.25 0.75))

; Let's wipe out the value as well.
(cog-set-value!
	(Concept "asdf")
	(Predicate "my key")
	(StringValue "sat" "on" "a" "wall"))

(cog-open psn)

(fetch-atom (Concept "asdf"))

; Look at all the keys attached to the atom:
(cog-keys (Concept "asdf"))

; Make sure the the current values are those restored from the database:
(cog-value (Concept "asdf") (Predicate "my key"))

; Other useful commands are:
;
; * `load-atomspace` and `store-atomspace` for bulk fetch and restore.
;   For large datasets, these can be slow. Extremely large datasets might
;   not fit in RAM, which is why `fetch-atom` is so handy!
;
; * `fetch-incoming-set` and `fetch-incoming-by-type` are extremely
;   useful for fetching all graphs that an atom belongs to. These
;   two are possibly the single most-important persistence calls in
;   the system. They really make the whole idea usable and easy-to-use.
;
; * `sql-stats` `sql-clear-stats` and `sql-clear-cache` print cryptic
;   performance data for the SQL backend.
;
; * `sql-open` and `sql-close` are similar to `cog-open` and `cog-close`,
;   except they take the URL directly. Unfortunately, this means that
;   one cannot work with more than one connection at a time this way.
;   Examples:
;   (sql-open "postgres://opencog_tester:cheese@localhost/opencog_test")
;   (sql-close)
;
; That's all for now.
