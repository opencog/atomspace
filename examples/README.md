AtomSpace Examples
------------------

This directory contains various examples and demos that illustrate
what the AtomSpace is, and what it's capable of doing.  You will
want to go through the contents here, as written in the order below.
By the end, you will have a very clear idea of what the AtomSpace is!

* atomspace     - Demos of all of the basic AtomSpace features and
                  functions. VISIT THIS FIRST!!

* pattern-matcher - Example code demonstrating the graph query system.
                  It shows how to search for data that fits a pattern,
